<!-- The "home-link" tag is empty because it gets filled in by the CSS
     with either "BAWG" or "Bay Area Wildflower Guide", depending on how
     much space is available.

     I don't put the year in the copyright because it's a pain to determine
     given the different creation/modification dates of the pages *plus*
     the photos on them.  The Berne Convention applies in any case. -->
