<h2>Usage Guide</h2>

The Bay Area Wildflower Guide (BAWG) is a collection of my own photos
and notes.  It is designed to be my own reference as well as something
I can point people to when I make flower identifications.
<b>Warning</b>: I am not a botanist, just an interested amateur.  All
flower identifications should be taken as my opinion and not
authoritative.

The BAWG is primarily for me, secondarily for you.  You can use it as
a reference if you like, but I hope you don't use it as your
sole reference.

The BAWG covers the San Francisco Bay Area, from the Pacific coast to
corners including Mt. Tamalpais, Mt. Diablo, San Luis Reservoir, and
Santa Cruz.  Some areas outside those bounds are also covered,
particularly Pinnacles National Park.  The gravitational center for my
observations is probably somewhere around Cupertino.

Only wildflowers are covered, not cultivated flowers.  I've also
started including taxons other than flowering plants here, but in much
smaller numbers.

I have a <a href="html/general%20glossary.html">glossary</a>.

When I'm identifying flowers from a hike, I often use
<a href="http://PlantID.net">PlantID.net</a>
to get a list of flowers known to grow in the park.

<a href="https://montereywildflowers.com/">Monterey County Wildflowers</a>
covers an adjacent region, so it is often useful for bay area species
as well.  It has a similar organization as this guide with both photos
and notes for how to distinguish species.
