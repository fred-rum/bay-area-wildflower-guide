<h1 id="title">Chrome Browser Notes for Offline Usage</h1>

Congratulations, Chrome currently has the best support for offline web apps.  That said, these notes may help improve your experience.

<h3>Keeping the Download Alive</h3>

Downloading files for offline use will continue in the background
while you browse the guide (including this page).
However, <b>downloading is likely to pause</b> in any of the following
cases:
. You put your device to sleep.
. You switch to your home screen or a different app.
. You browse to a different site.

If the download process is paused, just click the green button again
to resume.

Chrome will prevent your screen from timing out due to inactivity
while files are being downloaded for offline use, so you don't need to
actively use your device to keep the download alive.

On a desktop, it is sufficient to keep the Guide tab visible (not
minimized), even if another window has focus.

<h3>Storage Limits</h3>

Chrome allows a web app to use up to 100% of the storage space
available.  The Guide is large, but not that large.  Hopefully you can
find room.

Chrome uses a heuristic to determine whether offline files are kept
permanently.  If the browser decides you don't use the Guide often
enough, it may delete the files if space runs short.  In practice this
rarely happens.  If you bookmark the Guide or install it to your home
screen, this will give an extra hint to Chrome that you want to keep
your offline files.

<h3>Install to your Home Screen</h3>

You can save a link to the Guide on your home screen.  Open the Chrome
menu and select "Add to homescreen" or "Install Bay Area Wildflower
Guide".  On Android, this sometimes doesn't actually put anything on
your home screen.  If so, you can manually drag it from Android's
installed apps to your home screen.

<h3>Bandwidth While Offline</h3>

Because of the strange way that browsers work, every page load will
attempt to fetch ~25 KB from the internet even when the site is using
its local offline copy.  (E.g. viewing 40 pages will fetch ~1 MB.)  If
you have a large or unlimited data plan, this is nothing to worry
about.  If you have a very limited data plan, consider putting your
phone in airplane mode while using the site in offline mode.

<h3>Try it!</h3>

Return to the <a href="index.html">Guide home</a> and give offline
mode a try.
