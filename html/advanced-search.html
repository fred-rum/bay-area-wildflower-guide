<p>Advanced search lets you find all taxons that meet one or more criteria.
<b>JavaScript must be enabled in order for advanced search to work.</b></p>
<p>Advanced search builds on the capabilities of the regular <a href="search.html" class="family">search</a>
bar at the top of most pages.  To avoid confusion, the advanced search
page is the only page that does <b>not</b> have the regular search bar
at the top.  In order to perform a regular search, first leave the
advanced search page, e.g. by clicking the home page icon in the upper left.</p>
<p>Advanced search terms can be any of these forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>within a particular taxon hierarchy</li>
<li>with a particular trait</li>
<li>observed at a particular park</li>
<li>observed in a particular date range</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get to the advanced search page using any of these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>input any of the advanced search terms (above) into the regular search bar</li>
<ul>
<li>this starts an advanced search with that search term</li>
</ul>
<li>expand the observation details in any taxon page, then click the advanced search link at the bottom of the details</li>
<ul>
<li>this starts an advanced search within that taxon</li>
</ul>
<li>click <a href="../advanced-search.html">this link</a></li>
<ul>
<li>this starts an advanced search with no search terms</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>within <i>taxon</i></h4>
<p>An advanced search term with this form finds taxons within the specified taxon.
E.g. searching &ldquo;<a href="../advanced-search.html?genus-Eschscholzia">within desert poppies (genus <i>Eschscholzia</i>)</a>&ldquo; results in the following hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="desert-poppies.html" class="parent">desert poppies (genus <i>Eschscholzia</i>)</a></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="california-poppy.html" class="leaf">california poppy (<i>Eschscholzia californica</i>)</a></li>
<li><a href="tufted-poppy.html" class="leaf">tufted poppy (<i>Eschscholzia caespitosa</i>)</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>As with a <a href="search.html">regular search</a>, a partial common
name or scientific name can be specified, and the search bar will show
all matches.</p>
<p>When adding the term within the advanced search page, the &ldquo;within&rdquo;
prefix can be omitted and will be inferred.  However, the &ldquo;within&rdquo;
prefix is required when typing the advanced search term in the regular
search bar; otherwise the result will simply link to the taxon instead
of starting an advanced search.</p>
<p>You can enter multiple terms with the form &ldquo;within <i>taxon</i>&ldquo;, and
the results will include all taxons within any of the listed taxons.</p>
<h4>[prefix] <i>trait</i></h4>
<p>An advanced search term with this form finds taxons with the
specified trait.  E.g. searching
&ldquo;<a href="../advanced-search.html?blue-flowers">with blue flowers</a>&ldquo;
finds all flowers with blue as the primary petal color.</p>
<p>Searchable traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>with [color] flowers</li>
<ul>
<li>e.g. &ldquo;with blue flowers&rdquo;</li>
<li>The list of available color names can be found on the page for <a href="flowering-plants.html" class="family">flowering plants (subphylum <i>Angiospermae</i>)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>is [taxon origin]</li>
<ul>
<li>e.g. &ldquo;is native&rdquo;</li>
<li>See the help page for <a href="taxon-origin.html" class="unobs">taxon origin</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The prefix (e.g. &ldquo;is&rdquo;) usually can be omitted and will be
inferred.  However, when searching for taxons &ldquo;with [color] flowers&rdquo;,
the &ldquo;with&rdquo; prefix is required when typing the advanced search
term in the regular search bar; otherwise the result will link to a
static page listing the taxons with that trait instead of starting an
advanced search.</p>
<p>You can enter multiple terms that search for different values for the
same trait, e.g. to search for any taxon that &ldquo;is endemic&rdquo; or &ldquo;is
native&rdquo;.</p>
<h4>observed in <i>location</i></h4>
<p>An advanced search term with this form finds taxons that I have
observed at the specified location.  E.g. searching for
&ldquo;<a href="../advanced-search.html?Edgewood-Park-Natural-Preserve">Edgewood</a>&ldquo;
finds all taxons that I&rsquo;ve observed at Edgewood Park & Natural
Preserve.</p>
<p>Locations are usually park names, but can be other geographic
locations for observations outside parks.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;observed in&rdquo; prefix is optional in either the advanced search
field or the regular search bar.  However, including the prefix (or at
least &ldquo;in&rdquo;) helps to quickly narrow the results to just locations that
match the input.</p>
<p>You can enter multiple terms with the form &ldquo;observed in <i>location</i>&ldquo;, and
the results will include all taxons observed in any of of the listed locations.</p>
<h4>
observed in <i>yyyy</i>
<br>
observed in <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>
<br>
observed on <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<br>
observed since <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<br>
observed until <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<br>
observed after <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<br>
observed before <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<br>
observed between <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> and <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> (inclusive)
<br>
observed between <i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> and <i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> (inclusive)
</h4>
<p>An advanced search term with any of these forms finds taxons that I
have observed in the specified date range.  E.g. searching for
&ldquo;<a href="../advanced-search.html?in-2023">in 2023</a>&ldquo;
finds all taxons that I observed in 2023.</p>
<p>Note that &ldquo;since&rdquo; and &ldquo;until&rdquo; are inclusive of the listed date, while
&ldquo;after&rdquo; and &ldquo;before&rdquo; are exclusive.</p>
<p>While typing a date term, the guide autofills missing digits with
reasonable values.  E.g. searching for &ldquo;in 23&ndash;5&rdquo; searches for taxons
&ldquo;observed in 2023&ndash;05&rdquo;.  Be sure to type enough digits where necessary
to distinguish a year from a month.  This autofill assumes that every
month ends on the 31<sup>st</sup>.  This looks funny, but has no
adverse effect on the search results.</p>
<p>The form &ldquo;between <i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> and <i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>&ldquo; looks
for observations made with the specified season without regard to
year.  The first date is the start date, and the second date is the
end date.  If the second date comes before the first date, then the
search range is from the first date, through the new year, to the
second date.</p>
<p>At this time there is no shorthand search for taxons observed within
a specified month of any year.  Instead use &ldquo;between <i>mm</i>-01 and
<i>mm</i>-31&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;observed&rdquo; prefix is optional, but the specifier for
&ldquo;in/on/since/etc.&rdquo; must either be typed or selected from the list of
matching results.</p>
<p>You can enter multiple date terms, and the results will include all
taxons observed in any of of the listed date ranges.  E.g. using both
&ldquo;since&rdquo; and &ldquo;until&rdquo; is useful for finding taxons <b>not</b> observed
within a certain date range.</p>
<h3>multiple search terms</h3>
<p>After you enter a search term (and select one of the results), the
guide displays the search term and its results, but also opens another
input field where you can enter another search term.</p>
<p>If you enter multiple search terms of the same type, a search is
performed for the taxons that match any of the search terms (the first
<b>or</b> the second <b>or</b> &hellip;).</p>
<p>If you enter multiple search terms of different types, a search is
performed for the taxons that match all of the search terms (the first
<b>and</b> the second <b>and</b> &hellip;).</p>
<p>E.g. for these search terms</p>
<ul>
<li>sunflower family</li>
<li>with white flowers</li>
<li>in Edgewood</li>
<li>in Pulgas Ridge</li>
</ul>
<p>the result is those taxons in the sunflower family with white petals
that were observed at either Edgewood Park or Pulgas Ridge.</p>
<p>The guide automatically reorders your advanced search terms to put
terms of the same type together and to put terms of different types in
the prefered order.  However, there is nothing wrong with entering
terms in any order you like.</p>
<h3>editing search terms</h3>
<p>You can edit any existing advanced search term by clicking on it.  The
search term is replaced by an input field containing the text your
originally entered.  You can them modify or replace the text and
select an alternative result.  Alternatively, if you clear your input
text, the result list changes to &ldquo;clear this search term&rdquo;.  Select
that result or press the &rsquo;Enter&rsquo; key to remove your search term.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you press the &rsquo;Esc&rsquo; key while editing a search term,
it reverts to its original value.</p>
<h3>additional details for each taxon</h3>
<p>For each taxon listed in the advanced search results, the guide also
lists how many times I&rsquo;ve observed it in situations that match the
search terms.  (Technically, it is the number of matching trips during
which I&rsquo;ve observed the taxon.)</p>
<p>You can also get more details by clicking one of the options below:</p>
<ul>
<li>[trips]</li>
<li>[by month]</li>
<li>[by location]</li>
</ul>
<p>After clicking to get more details on a subject, you can click a
different option to see different details, or click the same option
again to close it.</p>
<h4>details for trips</h4>
<p>If you click &ldquo;[trips]&ldquo;, the guide shows the date and location for each
observation I&rsquo;ve made of the taxon.  This option is probably a lot
more useful for me than for you.  E.g. have I seen it recently?</p>
<h4>details by month</h4>
<p>If you click &ldquo;[by month]&ldquo;, the guide shows the number of observations
I&rsquo;ve made in each month, regardless of year.  This helps show the
months when the taxon is most easily observed.</p>
<h4>details by location</h4>
<p>If you click &ldquo;[by location]&ldquo;, the guide shows the number of
observations I&rsquo;ve made in each location.  This helps show the
bay area regions where the taxon is most common.</p>
<h3>navigation and bookmarks</h3>
<p>Whenever you add or change an advanced search term, the guide creates
a new page for the search.  Thus, you can navigate through your
searches via standard browser navigation forward and back.</p>
<p>You can also bookmark any advanced search page.  The search terms are
saved in the bookmark, and the search is performed again when you visit
the bookmark.</p>
