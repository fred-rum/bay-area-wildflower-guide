prevent 'enter' from following the photo link
  document.activeElement.blur()

collect pinch/drag position within image when pointerdown occurs
  if pinch/drag is outside the image, don't perform an action until
    a pointer move or new touch puts the position within the image
  perform zoom relative to the first collected position within the image
    i.e. if the image is constrained to not follow the pointer,
      it still behaves as much as possible as if it's still under the pointer

ensure that zoom stays within the desired bounds when resizing the window.
perhaps the 'fit' property should purely be for size,
     and the centering is set separately
  if we do this, then when zoom is constrained to fit,
    it could set 'fit' to true.
  and so it would continue to fit when the window is resized

add arrows on left and right (when appropriate) to switch photos
  also accept left and right keypresses
  also accept wheel let and right?

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

add X in corner?

does the image move more smoothly and/or more fully leave the screen
    if has absolute/fixed position instead of margin positioning?
  with top & right properties for position

prevent image from leaving the screen

display thumbnail until full photo arrives
  perhaps with spinny icon dimly on top
