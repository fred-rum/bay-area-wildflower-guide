reloading the gallery shrinks the image because it's applying the same zoom
  to the smaller thumbnail (and then shrinking the full-sized photo to match).

check that the spinner is reliably started and stopped as appopriate
  especially on reload/navigation

why are e_bg and e_spin re-created when they only need to be re-added?

can I improve pinching performance on Firefox?
  perhaps fewer updates?

add arrows on left and right (when appropriate) to switch photos
  also accept left and right keypresses
  also accept wheel let and right?

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

add X in corner?

can I disable or capture browser zoom while in the gallery?

optional:

when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons
