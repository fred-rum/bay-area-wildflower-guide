display attributions or other text
  as black text on a translucent background over the bottom of the image
    (i) icon in lower left allows text to be hidden or re-displayed?
    add a key binding to show/hide the text, e.g. 'i'.
if Javascript is disabled, put copyrights/attributions below the images
  e.g. photos #1 and #3 CC0 by Ren & Stimpy
  or put the copyright/attribution text in place of the thumbnail image
    (which is ugly, but JavaScript is heavily encouraged for the BAWG)

support text with photo

add 'tab' to go to next image, 'shift-tab' to go to previous
  or would that interfere with keyboard navigation in/around the text?

remove zoom restriction
  can I test pinch with zoom?
  e.g. within the text area


optional:

when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons

button for full screen view?
  can it be hidden on mobile where it is intrinsically already full-screen?
    document.fullscreenEnabled
  see Wikipedia for icons to enter and exit full-screen mode

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

present the filename
  only when viewing locally? (no http)
