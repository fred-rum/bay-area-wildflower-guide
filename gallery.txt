add arrows on left and right (when appropriate) to switch photos
  also accept left and right keypresses
  also accept wheel let and right?

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

add X in corner?

display spinny icon (above thumbnail) until full-sized photo is loaded
  the spinny icon should be some kind of inline image
    otherwise we'd have to wait for it to load
  or perhaps a canvas element with dynamically animated content
  mouse icon isn't visible in mobile, so an explicit image is needed

can I disable or capture browser zoom while in the gallery?

optional:

when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons
