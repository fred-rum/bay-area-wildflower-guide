do "example" photo links go to the gallery without duplicating a photo?
  is the thumbnail correct?

index.txt links directly to galler.html?home,
  but instead it should link directly to the figure
    and let the Javascript convert the link
  automatically resize jpg figures into thumbnails (e.g. in figure-thumbs)
  automatically derive thumbnail path from jpg name and directory
  use JS to convert link to jpg/svg in photos or figures
    search for link, not for thumbnail (document.links)
  use python to detect link to jpg/svg in photos or figures and add it to the
    master list
  is '?search' portion of URL named after image filename or HTML title?
    what '?search' should be used in index.txt?

make 'X' shorter and thicker

add 'tab' to go to next image, 'shift-tab' to go to previous

allow a 'click' to have a small amount of pointer movement
  as long as it stays within the original element
  event.target.setPointerCapture(...) may be useful

support text with photo

remove zoom restriction
  can I test pinch with zoom?


optional:
`
when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons

button for full screen view?
  can it be hidden on mobile where it is intrinsically already full-screen?
    document.fullscreenEnabled
  see Wikipedia for icons to enter and exit full-screen mode

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

present the filename
  only when viewing locally? (no http)
