When an image is 'complete', and we re-enter the gallery,
  we don't know if it's really complete or if it had an error.

Replace 'zoom' with 'width'.
  Makes state restore easier and also switching from thumbnail to full size.

can I improve pinching performance on Firefox?
  perhaps fewer updates?

add arrows on left and right (when appropriate) to switch photos
  also accept left and right keypresses
  also accept wheel let and right?

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

add X in corner?

can I disable or capture browser zoom while in the gallery?

optional:

when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons

While the thumbnail is loading,
  have a light gray square behind it to indicate its eventual size
    (or similar pattern)
