zoom to fit/full on space or enter

accept left and right arrow keypresses to switch photos
  also accept wheel left and right?

add X in corner?

can I disable or capture browser zoom while in the gallery?
  do I want to?
  e.g. ctrl-mouse wheel
  measure event.scale?

make wheel event passive


optional:
`
when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons

button for full screen view?
  can it be hidden on mobile where it is intrinsically already full-screen?
    document.fullscreenEnabled
  see Wikipedia for icons to enter and exit full-screen mode

allow a 'click' to have a small amount of pointer movement
  as long as it stays within the original element
  event.target.setPointerCapture(...) may be useful

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?
