move gallery.js and gallery.css to src/

test thumbnails of CalPhotos images

make photo gallery viewer work with figures
  (e.g. in glossary, but also if they are used in a page)

make body background $404040
  so that crazy #gallery-background margins aren't required

should I create a gallery.html page
  that is invoked by Javascript
  and includes the list of photos in its URL?
    e.g. with hash to selected photo
    or an included file lists all photo associations

previous selected region remains partially visible in Android Chrome
  when the gallery is open

arrow is slow to disappear at the end of the carrousel
  because of the transition delay?

remove hover application as necessary

pinch is wonky when the browser is zoomed in
  use windowX/Y instead of clientX/Y?

zoom to fit/full on space or enter

add arrows on left and right (when appropriate) to switch photos
  also accept left and right keypresses
  also accept wheel left and right?

can I recognize a flick left or right for switching photos?
  is getPredictedEvents() useful?

add X in corner?

can I disable or capture browser zoom while in the gallery?
  do I want to?
  e.g. ctrl-mouse wheel

optional:
`
when resizing (and not touching), remember the desired photo zoom & pos
  start from those values when constraining the photo
  so that resizing up and down will restore the photo as much as possible

explicit zoom buttons

button for full screen view?
  can it be hidden on mobile where it is intrinsically already full-screen?
    document.fullscreenEnabled
  see Wikipedia for icons to enter and exit full-screen mode

allow a 'click' to have a small amount of pointer movement
  as long as it stays within the original element
  event.target.setPointerCapture(...) may be useful
