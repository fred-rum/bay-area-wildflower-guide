<h1 id="title">Safari Browser Notes for Offline Usage</h1>
<p>The amount of offline storage needed for this guide is quite
reasonable on modern devices, but it is still an intense experience
for some browsers.  Hopefully these notes will prevent frustration on
your end.</p>
<h3>Keeping the Download Alive</h3>
<p>Downloading files for offline use will continue in the background
while you browse the guide (including this page).
However, <b>downloading is likely to pause</b> in any of the following
cases: Your device goes to sleep.  (You might need to occasionally
touch your mobile screen if it would otherwise time out due to
inactivity.)  You switch to your home screen or a different app.  You
browse to a different site.</p>
<p>If the downloading process is paused, just click the green button
again to resume.</p>
<p><b>Warning: iOS 11 through iOS 13 have a known bug</b> that crashes
the downloading process in any of the above cases.  If it does crash,
try closing the tab, waiting 10 seconds, and then returning to the
Guide.  I don&rsquo;t know if that will work, but it sounds plausible.  This
iOS bug is fixed in iOS 14.  Web apps are not supported at all prior
to iOS 11.1.</p>
<p>On MacOS, it should be sufficient to keep the Guide tab visible (not
minimized), even if another window has focus.</p>
<h3>Storage Limits</h3>
<p>Safari doesn&rsquo;t allow web apps to monitor the space being used or the
storage limit.  Safari generally allows a web app to use 1 GB+, so the
guide will fit as long as you have space available.</p>
<p>Safari places a <b>time limit of ~7 days</b> on offline data.
Re-visiting the Guide will refresh the time limit.</p>
<p><b>Saving the Guide to your home page might remove the time limit.</b>
(Testing is in progress.)  To save to your home page, tap the browser
icon with an arrow pointing out of a square (normally used for sharing
a page).  Then scroll down (not right) and select &ldquo;Add to Home
Screen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read down this far, congratulations.  You might be the kind
of person who runs their browser in Private Browsing mode.  As usual,
all of your data from Private Browsing will be deleted when you leave
Safari.  So you&rsquo;ll need to disable Private Browsing before downloading
the Guide&rsquo;s offline files.  And don&rsquo;t forget to disable Private
Browsing when downloading updates later.</p>
<h3>Try it!</h3>
<p>Return to the <a href="index.html">Guide home</a> and give offline
mode a try.  If it doesn&rsquo;t work, online browsing remains supported as
always.</p>
