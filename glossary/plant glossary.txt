<h2>Parts of a leaf</h2>

{leaf (leaves),leaved} The major parts of a leaf are the blade, petiole, and stipule.  The petiole and stipule may each be present or not, while the blade may be very small or needle-like.

{blade,blades,leaf blade,leaf blades} The expanded portion of a leaf where photosynthesis primarily occurs.  May be simple or compound with multiple leaflets.
{petiole,petioles,petioled} The stalk of a leaf.
{stipule,stipules} Extension at the base of the petiole. [figure:narrow-leaved clover]

{leaflet,leaflets} A division of a compound leaf (which may itself be further compound).  Can be distinguished from a leaf by the lack of any structures in its axil other than more leaflets or occasionally stipules.

<h2>3-D shapes (e.g. for an involucre)</h2>

All flower#involucre shapes may be flared at the tip or not, which is independent of the shape listed below.

{bell-shaped,bell} Rapidly widening at the base, then slowly expanding toward the tip.
{cylindric,cylindrical} Significantly longer than wide with parallel sides.
{ovoid} Egg shaped; widest between the middle and the base.
{obovoid} Egg shaped; widest between the middle and the tip.
{rotate} Saucer-shaped.  For a flower#corolla, generally means a fused base with little or no flower#tube and spreading flower#limbs.
{urn-shaped,urn} Rapidly widening at the base, then narrowed toward the tip.

<h2>2-D shapes (e.g. for a leaf)</h2>

Particularly for leaves, the base of the blade may taper to the petiole regardless of the shape description. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Examples-of-leaf-shapes_fig1_295685020">[example leaf shapes]</a>

{awl-like} Long, narrow, and pointed, but slightly wider at the base, so not quite linear.

{reniform} In the shape of a dented oval, with the petiole connection in the dent.  Depending on your source, the distinction from cordate is that the tip of the blade is rounded (instead of pointed) or that the blade base is concave around the petiole attachment (instead of sharply notched). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Examples-of-leaf-shapes_fig1_295685020">[example]</a>
