<p>A single flower head in the sunflower family is actually a tight inflorescence of many flowers, often with separate shapes for the center disk flowers and outer ray flowers.</p>

{bristle,bristles} A stiff, hairlike tip of a pappus element.
{disk,disks} The collective term for all disk flowers in a head.
{disk flower,disk flowers} A flower in the central portion of a head in the sunflower family.  Usually radial and 5-lobed, usually bisexual but sometimes staminate.  Often surrounded by ray flowers.
{head,heads,flower head,flower heads} A tight inflorescence in the sunflower family which appears from a distance to be a single flower.
{involucre,involucres} The green base of a flower head in the sunflower family.  See also the general definition of involucre.
{ligule,ligules,ligulate flower,ligulate flowers} A ray-like flower that is clustered only with other ligules to form a head in the sunflower family (i.e. one without disk flowers).
{pappus,pappuses,pappi} A modified calyx composed of some combination of scales, awns, and/or bristles.  In some species, the pappus forms a parachute for seed dispersal.
{pappus element,pappus elements} A modified sepal; one part among similar parts that make up the pappus.
{phyllary,phyllaries} A bract of the flower head in the sunflower family.  A member of the involucre.
{ray,rays,ray flower,ray flowers} A flower in the outer portion of a head in the sunflower family.  Flat and uni-directional, not radial.  May be distally lobed.  Usually pistillate, but sometimes sterile.  The rays form a ring around the central disk.

<h2>Inflorescence shapes</h2>

<p>Within the sunflower family, these terms describe the organization of multiple heads in a larger inflorescence.  For most of these terms, the order of development among heads is not defined.</p>

{cyme,cymes} A branched inflorescence in which a head at an axil develops before heads on the subtending branches.
{panicle,panicles} An inflorescence in which at least some heads are attached to inflorescence branches rather than the central axis.
{raceme,racemes} An inflorescence with stalked heads attached directly to the inflorescence axis (not to branches).
{spike,spikes} An inflorescence with sessile heads attached directly to the inflorescence axis (not to branches).
{umbel,umbels} An inflorescence in which 3+ stalked heads radiate from a common point with no continuation of the central axis.

<h2>Sexual capability</h2>

{staminate flower,staminate flowers,staminate} A flower#staminate disk flower.
{pistillate flower,pistillate flowers,pistillate} A flower#pistillate ray flower.
