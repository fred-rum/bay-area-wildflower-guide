<p>Grass morphology is described <a href="https://forages.oregonstate.edu/regrowth/how-does-grass-grow/grass-structures" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

{auricle,auricles} A short appendiage at the base of the leaf blade, typically clasping the sheath.
{awn,awns} A bristle extending from the midrib of the lemma.  It may extend from the tip of the lemma from from the outer surface.
{callus,calluses} The enlarged, hard base of a lemma.
{floret,florets} A unit of a spikelet, composed of a flower or caryopsis (fruit) enclosed by a nested pair of bractlets, the palea on the inside, and the lemma on the outside.
{glume,glumes} A bract (usually in a pair) at the base of a spikelet.
{lemma,lemmas} The outer bractlet enclosing the floret.
{palea (paleae),paleate} The inner bractlet enclosing the floret.
{rachis} The part of a grass stem along which flower stalks are spaced at short intervals.
{spikelet,spikelets} The rough equivalent of an inflorescence for grasses.  A spikelet is one or more florets growing alternately along a rachilla.  Multiple spikelets may be borne along the rachis.  Note that a spikelet is not necessarily related to a spike.

<h2>Inflorescence shapes</h2>

<p>Within the grasses, these terms describe the organization of multiple epikelets in a larger inflorescence.  The order of development among spikelets is not defined.</p>

{panicle,panicles} An inflorescence in which at least some spikelets are attached to inflorescence branches rather than the central axis.  The order in which heads develop is not defined.
{raceme,racemes} An inflorescence with stalked spikelets attached directly to the inflorescence axis (not to branches).
{spike,spikes} An inflorescence with sessile spikelets attached directly to the inflorescence axis (not to branches).
{umbel,umbels} An inflorescence in which 3+ stalked spikelets radiate from a common point with no continuation of the central axis.
