<p>A pea flower has five petals in a bilateral arrangement (not radial).</p>

{banner,banners} The topmost petal.  It may have a crease down the middle that makes it looks like two petals stuck together, or it may be curled around the other petals.  Also called the "standard petal". [figure:chaparral pea]
{wing,wings} Each of the two none#lateral petals below the banner, often fused at their top edge and enfolding the keel. [figure:chaparral pea]
{keel,keels} The two bottom petals collectively, often fused at their bottom edge.  May be partially or fully hidden by the wings. [figure:chaparral pea]
