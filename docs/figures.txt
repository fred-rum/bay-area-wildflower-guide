SVG figures are displayed full-size by simply loading the file
directly into the browser.  Thus, the SVG properties must be correct
in order to be automatically fit to the window size.

In Inkscape (as of 0.92):
  Edit -> XML Editor...
    Select the top element, "svg:svg ..."
      Select "height"
        Input the value "100%" and press ctrl-enter
      Select "width"
        Input the value "100%" and press ctrl-enter
  File -> Document Properties...
    In the box for "Scale", open the section for "Viewbox..."
       Set X to 0
       Set Y to 0

Although it's tempting to edit the SVG directly, doing so will cause
it to be drawn to the wrong scale relative to the viewbox.  Editing
the XML properties within Inkscape will cause Inkscape to rescale the
drawing automatically.
