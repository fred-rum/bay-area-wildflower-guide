Fill in the form as follows:
Taxon: [unrestricted so that ferns, etc. are included]
User: chris_nelson
Basic:
  id
  observed_on
  quality_grade
  captive_cultivated (although the script doesn't use it yet)
Geo:
  place_guess
  private_place_guess
Taxon:
  scientific_name
  common_name
  taxon_id
Taxon Extras:
  taxon_kingdom_name -through- taxon_genus_name
  taxon_species_name
  (genus and species names can usually be derived from the species/subspecies
    name, but if the observation rank is something like 'subgenus'.)
Observation Fields:
  none

If the private_place_guess is supplied, it is more precise and so is
used instead of the place_guess.  See parks_format.txt for how the
place (location) is interpreted.

Where the scientific name and common name are both given, they supply
a default mapping (in either direction) for any flower that only has
one name manually entered.  If the scientific name is known, but the
common name differs from what the txt files have, it is recorded as an
alternative common name.

The various higher-level taxon names are used to construct a Linnaean
tree which is mostly used for properties.  See properties.txt for
details.
