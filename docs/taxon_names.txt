The group_names.yaml file associates scientific names with common
names.  This is a handy way to specify common names for pages created
via the 'create' property, although it can be used for other purposes.

The format for each line is "(elab name): (com name)".  "n/a" can be
used in place of the common name to indicate that it has no common
name.  Specifying "n/a" prevents warnings on pages that would
otherwise be expected to have a common name.

As a shortcut when listing many pages of the same rank, a line can be
"{rank}:", followed by any number of indented lines
"  {sci name}: {com name}".

The "rank" is actually treated as a generic prefix, and the mechanism
can be repeated with increased indenting to create a longer string,
although I'm not sure what use that would be.
