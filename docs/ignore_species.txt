scientific name: [+/-]comment explaining why it should be permanently ignored
from the observations.csv data.

Use + before the comment to include the observation in the count at the
higher level.

Use - to exclude it from any counts.  This feature is less useful now that
I can exclude by area, but it still might be handy, e.g. for cultivated
flowers.
