       by the user can hide or reveal the URL bar.  I suppose that
       makes sense, but as the URL bar is dragged away, it reveals
       extra area in the viewport that the gallery background can't
       immediately respond to.  I.e. the underlying window color is
       partially revealed, which looks ugly and awkward.  To prevent
       this reveal, we make the gallary background much larger than
       the viewport so that everything remains hidden even if the
