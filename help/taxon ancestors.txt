Each taxon is one part of a chain of taxonomic relationships from the
top level (all {-life}) down to the lowest species or subspecies
level.

Each intermediate taxon represents a grouping of related taxons.  In
the common phylogenetic taxonomy used in science, all taxons in the
intermediate group are more related to each other than to any other
group.  However, the BAWG also includes informal taxons (such as all
{-galls}) to represent taxons that are conceptually similar even if
not directly related.

In order to better establish the relationship of a taxon to others,
each taxon page lists the interesting higher-level taxons that it is a
member of.  "Interesting" generally means those taxons with sufficient
general use to have a common name, but for brevity the list generally
excludes high-level taxons that are obvious (such as {-animals}).
