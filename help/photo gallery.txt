The photo gallery allows you to examine the high-resolution photos for
each taxon.  It is also used for certain other images, e.g. figures
used in a glossary.

Note that the photo gallery is only used if JavaScript is enabled in
your browser.  If JavaScript is disabled, the browser's default image
viewer is used instead.

Here's an <a href="../gallery.html?california-poppy.2">example</a> photo gallery to practice with.


<h2>mouse actions</h2>

<h4>navigation</h4>

Click the white arrow on the right or left to switch to the next or
previous photo.
The arrows only appear if there is more than one photo in the gallery.

To return to the originating page, do any of the following:
. click the red X in the upper corner
. click the gray background outside the image
. click your browser's "back" button

<h4>zoom</h4>

Click anywhere in the image to zoom to fit (the default zoom level).
If the image is already zoomed to fit, it instead zooms to the maximum
pixel-accurate resolution.  (You can zoom closer than this if you want
the image to be even bigger.)

Scroll the mouse wheel up or down to zoom in or out.  The image zooms
toward or away from the point under the mouse cursor.

<h4>pan</h4>

To move the image, press the mouse button down anywhere within the
viewing area and move the mouse while holding the button down.  This
is particularly useful for viewing other parts of the image while
zoomed in.


<h2>touch actions</h2>

<h4>navigation</h4>

Tap the white arrow on the right or left to switch to the next or
previous photo.
The arrows only appear if there is more than one photo in the gallery.

To return to the originating page, do any of the following:
. tap the red X in the upper corner
. tap the gray background outside the image
. tap your browser's "back" button (if it has one)

<h4>zoom</h4>

Tap anywhere in the image to zoom to fit (the default zoom level).  If
the image is already zoomed to fit, it instead zooms to the maximum
pixel-accurate resolution.  (You can zoom closer than this if you want
the image to be even bigger.)

Touch two fingers to the sensor and drag them away from each other or
pinch them together to zoom in or out.  The image zooms toward or away
from the point between your fingers.

<h4>pan</h4>

To move the image, touch anywhere within the viewing area and drag
your finger across the sensor.  This is particularly useful for
viewing other parts of the image while zoomed in.


<h2>keyboard actions</h2>

<h4>navigation</h4>

Press the right or left arrow key to switch to the next or previous
photo.
The arrows only appear if there is more than one photo in the gallery.

To return to the originating page, do any of the following:
. press the 'Esc' key
. press your browser's standard "back" key
.. this may be a special key on your keyboard and/or Alt-left arrow

<h4>zoom</h4>

Press the space bar or 'Enter' key to zoom to fit (the default zoom level).
If the image is already zoomed to fit, it instead zooms to the maximum
pixel-accurate resolution.  (You can zoom closer than this if you want
the image to be even bigger.)

Press 'Page Up' or 'Page Down' to zoom in or out.  The image zooms
toward or away from the center of the viewing area.

<h4>pan</h4>

Sorry, there are currently no keys to pan the image.
