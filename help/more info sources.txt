Where possible, each taxon page links to additional taxon information on other websites:
. iNaturalist has information on almost every taxon that has a scientific name
. The following sites have information on vascular plants:
.. Calflora has range information and some photos
.. CalPhotos has lots of photos
.. Jepson eFlora has identifying information and keys, mostly in dense textual form
.. Flora of North America (FNA) also has identifying information and keys, as well as additional descriptions
... however, FNA is a work in progress and doesn't yet include all families of plants
. BugGuide has additional information for insects, spiders, and related "bugs"
.. links to BugGuide are currently manual, so not every applicable taxon has one yet
. Gallformers has additional information for any organisms that cause plant galls
. All About Birds has additional information for birds

The lowest-level taxons are most reliably linked.  Higher level taxons
may link to fewer sites, usually because the site doesn't have
information at higher levels or simply doesn't have <i>useful</i>
information at higher levels (e.g. CalPhotos).

Due to the shifting research regarding taxonomic relationships, many
scientific names have changed over time.  Where an external site uses
a different scientific name than the BAWG, that difference is noted.

CalPhotos does not attempt to use a single scientific name for a
taxon, but simply lists photos under whatever name was submitted for
each.  Therefore, links to CalPhotos sometimes use multiple scientific
names in order to retrieve all relevant photos.
