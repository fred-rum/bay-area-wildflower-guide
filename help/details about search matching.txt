The search bar finds results for which your input text can be found
within the {-taxon names}, glossary term, etc.

Wherever your input text includes spaces or punctuation, the search
bar allows any number of characters to be skipped in the result text.
E.g. "cl-av" (with or without quotes) matches any of the following
results:

. genus <span class="match">Clav</span>ulina
. <span class="match">clav</span>us <span class="altname">(glossary: true bugs)</span>
. davy's clarkia (<i><span class="match">Cl</span>arkia a<span class="match">av</span>yi</i>)
. santa <span class="match">cl</span>ar<span class="match">a v</span>alley dudleya (<i>Dudleya abramsii ssp. setchellii</i>)
. etc.

Note that "clav" without a space or punctuation in the middle will
match only the first two results above.  It won't match any result
with additional letters between the "cl" and the "av".  On the other
hand, a search for "hedgenettle" will match a taxon called
"hedge-nettle" since the sequence of letters is the same once
punctuation is ignored.

The search looks for a match in the common name, scientific name, and
any alternative names of every taxon.  It also looks for any
variations of a glossary term, e.g. "sepals" matches the "sepal"
glossary term.

Results are ordered with priority given to a match that starts with
the input text.  Otherwise, taxons are ordered with the most commonly
observed taxons first.  Other result types (e.g. glossary terms) are
ordered according to the whims of the code.

<h2>search by common name</h2>

If the taxon has one or more alternative common names, you can also
search for these.  The search results show the primary name with the
matched alternative name in brackets.  E.g.

. sticky monkeyflower <span class="altname">[orange bush monkeyflower]</span> (<i>Diplacus aurantiacus</i>)

If the guide contains one or more subspecies or varieties of a
species, but doesn't have a page for the species itself, you can still
search for the species name, and the search results will show the
infraspecific pages.  E.g.

. siskiyou aster <span class="altname">[panicled aster]</span> (<i>Symphyotrichum lanceolatum</i> var. <i>hesperium</i>)

<h2>search by scientific name</h2>

When searching for a scientific name, you can include rank specifiers
such as "genus" or "var.".  In this guide, the rank is always spelled
out except for infraspecific ranks, which are always abbreviated
"ssp.", "var.", or "f."  As with all searches, however, you may choose
to omit any words (or parts of words) that you like.  A match that
begins at the start of a taxon's name is given priority over a match
later in a name, even if the rank prefix is omitted.

If the taxon has one or more alternative scientific names, you can
also search for these.  This includes only those names listed on the
taxon page, e.g. for CalFlora, Jepson's eFlora, etc.  It does not
include all historical synonyms.  The search results show the primary
name with the matched alternative name in brackets.  E.g.

. sticky monkeyflower (<i>Diplacus aurantiacus</i> <span class="altname">[<i>Mimulus aurantiacus</i>]</span>)

If the guide contains pages within a genus, but doesn't have a page
for the genus itself, you can still search for the genus name, and the
search results will show the relevant pages.  E.g.

. california thrift (<i>Armeria maritima</i> ssp. <i>californica</i> <span class="altname">[<i>genus Armeria</i>]</span>)

Of course, if you just search for the genus name without the "genus"
prefix, e.g. "Armeria", it will match all taxons in that genus.

<h2>search by glossary term</h2>

You can search for a glossary term, and the search results link
directly to its definition on the glossary page.

You can also search for certain expected variations of a term, such as
the plural form (e.g. "lemmas" or "teeth").

To restrict the search to only glossary terms (e.g. not taxons),
include the word "glossary" after the search term.

<h2>search for help pages</h2>

You can search for a help page by its title.  Include the word "help"
before the title to restrict the search to help pages.

<h2>search by advanced search term</h2>

You can start an advanced search by typing an {-advanced search} term
in the regular search bar, e.g. "within flowering plants".  The result
links to the advanced search page with the corresponding search term.
