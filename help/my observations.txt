At the bottom of each taxon page is a count of how many times I've
observed and identified the taxon on iNaturalist.  This provides an
indication of how common or rare a taxon is.  The number of these
observations that are
"<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/help#quality">research grade</a>"
is also listed to provide some measure of the quality of my IDs.

There is also a link to iNaturalist to allow you to review my
observations in more detail.  This link is likely more useful to me
than to you.  More likely of use to you is the link to iNaturalist's
taxon page in the next section with {-more info sources}.

If you click the observations line anywhere other than the obvious
link (e.g. on "show details"), the observations section expands to
show the number of observations per location and per month.  This
helps demonstrate where and when the taxon is most easily found.
Caveat: I don't visit all locations equally often, and I tend to
prefer some locations in certain months, which skews the data.

At the bottom of the expanded observation details is a link to
{-advanced search}.  Clicking this link starts an advanced search
within the taxon.
