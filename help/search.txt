At the top of almost every page is an input field where you can type a search term.
<b>JavaScript must be enabled in order for search to work.</b>

While you type in the search bar, it displays a list of up to 10 results that match the text typed so far.  Click any result to navigate to that page.

The search bar is attached to the top of the window so that it remains accessible even when the page is scrolled.

The following data can be found via the search bar:
. a taxon (by common or scientific name)
. a glossary definition (by term being defined)
. a help page (by title)
. an advanced search
