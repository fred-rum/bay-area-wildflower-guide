<h3>edibility</h3>

I've gathered edibility information off the internet for those species
that look like they might be worthwhile to taste.

<b>Disclaimer: I got this information off the internet and cannot
vouch for its accuracy.</b>  As usual, the dose makes the poison.  For
anything that isn't a commonly recognized food (e.g. blackberries),
you should stick to a small sample for your first try.

The edibility information here is generally for the raw plant
material.  If you're interested in further preparation, check the
internet or other sources for instructions.

<h3>toxicity</h3>

I gathered toxicity information from the website of the California
Poison Control System (hereafter called CalPoison, although their
official abbreviation is CPCS).

When I gathered the info,
<a href="https://calpoison.org/topics/plant">this page</a>
had extensive lists of known toxic and non-toxic plants.
Those lists appear to have been purged from CalPoison's website
since then.  To see the lists yourself, you'll need
visit an archive such as the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230706193624/https://calpoison.org/topics/plant">Wayback Machine</a>.

<b>Disclaimer: CalPoison only includes the most commonly encountered
plants.</b>  If no toxicity information is listed, that means the plant
could be toxic or non-toxic.  In addition, if a plant is listed as
non-toxic, that probably only refers to the parts most likely to be
eaten (e.g. berries or leaves).  Eating other parts of the plant or
excessive amounts of the non-toxic parts is not advised.

CalPoison groups plants into certain toxicity categories, so the
details of any toxic response tend to get blurred together.  In
addition, CalPoison rarely notes which parts of the plant are toxic
and which are not.  In many cases, the toxicity information lists
multiple common names of plants within a genus, but it isn't clear
whether it applies to all species in the genus.  In case of ambiguity,
I advise you to play it safe.

As a point of reference, my "edibility" searches have turned up many
references to Native Americans using a wide variety of plants as
emetics or purgatives.  Something to think about before you taste
something unfamiliar.

With all of the above said, a tiny taste (e.g. one or two berries) is
unlikely to do much harm.  If in serious doubt, call CalPoison at
