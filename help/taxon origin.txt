Most taxons at the species level and below have origin information
imported from iNaturalist.  Specifically, the taxon may be:
. endemic to California (not native anywhere else)
. native to California (and other locations)
. alien (a.k.a. not native)

The taxon origin is abbreviated as a single letter (E, N, or A) to the
right of its names.  You can hover your mouse over this letter to
expand it to a full word.  On a device without a mouse, tap the letter
to expand or contract the word.

The taxon origin may be blank if iNaturalist does not have origin
information for it.
