The taxon description may contain wildly different amounts of text,
depending on the taxon.

When a taxon contains lower level taxons, the most commonly useful
description is a key to its child taxons.  The key is usually in the
form of a bulleted list of features for each each child taxon that
help distinguish it from its sibling taxons.  A taxon key is common
for plant genuses (where the species often look much alike), but it is
also occasionally used for a species (that has subspecies or
varieties) or for higher-level taxons.  If, however, the child taxons
are easily distinguished visually, the parent taxon may simply have a
list of its children without further information.

In many cases, the description for the lowest-level taxon is simply a
repeat of its key info from its parent taxon.  If the parent taxon has
no key info, the child's description may be blank.
