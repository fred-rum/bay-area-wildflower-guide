Although the BAWG is by no means complete, where a flowering plant
appears in the guide, I attempt to also include all other interesting
bay area species in the same genus (since they are likely to look
similar and be easily confused).  However, you can get a more
authoritative list from a link to "Bay Area species" at the bottom of
many taxon pages.

iNaturalist is linked for almost every taxon with a scientific name.
It lists all species in the bay area within the genus or a
higher-level taxon.  It does not list subspecies or varieties.
iNaturalist doesn't support an arbitrary map region, so it filters the
species based on a map square that includes additional area out to
Stockton.

CalFlora is linked for most taxons within vascular plants.  It only
works at the family or genus level, but it includes species
and subspecies.  It uses a map filter for the bay area that matches
the boundaries of the <a href="../index.html">BAWG</a>.

For both iNaturalist and CalFlora, a link from a low-level taxon
always includes all species within the same genus.  A link from a
higher-level taxon includes all species within that taxon.
