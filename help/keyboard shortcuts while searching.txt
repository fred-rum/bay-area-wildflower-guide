By default, the first search result is highlighted in bold.  Press
'Enter' to navigate to the highlighted result.

Press the down arrow or the 'Tab' key to move the highlight to the
next result (wrapping around from the last result).

Press the up arrow or Shift-tab to move the highlight to the previous
result (wrapping around from the first result).

The left and right arrow keys move the cursor within the input text in
the usual way.

Press the 'Esc' key to clear your input text.  (Exception: while
editing an {-advanced search} term, the 'Esc' key reverts the search
term to its original value.)
