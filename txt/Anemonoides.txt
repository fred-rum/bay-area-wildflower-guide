Summarizing <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2728894">this conversation</a>...
CalFlora lists two Anemone species in the bay area: A. grayi and
A. oregana.  However, the accepted range for A. oregana does not
extend very far into California from Oregon.  Calflora's records are
probably confused by the complicated nomenclatural history of these
species.  The only species that is truly accepted in the bay area is
A. grayi.
