sci:Lasthenia spp.
x:rare

Key features:
. phyllaries free or partially fused (and what percent is fused)
. number of phyllaries
. leaf shape
. ray length
. pappus present or not, color, opacity (pappus <a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0514+0357">in flower</a>, <a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0511+0368">in seed</a>)

Distinguishing goldfields often requires examining the pappus.  The pappus takes the place of the calyx/sepals in the disk flowers.  If the flower is in bloom, the pappus is typically shorter than the disk corolla, so to see it you'll need to bend the ray flowers and down with a thumbnail, pull the flower head apart, or perhaps pull out one disk flower (which may bring the pappus with it or leave it attached to the ovary.  I need to test that idea.)  Once the flower goes to seed and the corollas fall off, the pappus is much easier to see and often looks like a dandelion's seed pod.

See also {-hillside daisies}, which have narrow (but not linear) wedge-shaped leaves that are quite hairy.
