All California species have a spur sticking out behind the lower petal
which is key to identification.  This spur may be difficult to spot
since it is likely to be greenish and snuggled up against the flower
stalk.

Key features:
. leaves parallel to stem and folded lengthwise or ascending and not folded
. perianth color
. sepals spreading or reflexed
. spur length, held horizontally or curved along the stalk.

CalFlora and Jepson have this species correctly in Platanthera.

. <b>2 leaves, alternate, along stem, with 1 lengthwise fold</b>

CalFlora and Jepson have these species in their old genus, Piperia.

These flowers have 2--5 +- basal leaves which Jepson does not describe
in detail.  Possibly they are ascending, but not completely parallel
to the stem nor folded lengthwise.
