<b>Warning</b>: "fuller's teasel" is used for either or both teasels depending on the source.

Key features:
. receptacle bract shape, flexible or not [these are the short spines throughout the teasel head (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/28004394#identification-102852328">info source</a>)]
. involucre bract shape [these are the long spines sprouting from the base]
. leaves widely or narrowly fused around stem
. flower color

The receptacle bracts are the dense bracts dominating the head (one receptacle bract per flower).  The involucre bracts are the few much longer bracts subtending the head.
