All bay area species are in <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/779781-Limnia">section Limnia</a>.

<b>Caution: IDs uncertain</b>

Plants have a rosette of basal leaves which may be green to red, prostrate to erect.  The leaf blades may be inconspicuous, making the basal leaves look thoroughly unleaflike.  They may instead look very stem-like.  <b>Be sure to isolate and highlight the basal leaves for photography.</b>

Plants have exactly 2 opposite cauline leaves per stem, often fused or partially fused into a disc.

Key features:
. shape of basal leaves
. shape of cordate leaves
. number of bracts per inflorescence
. flower petal length
