sci:Claytonia spp.
x:ba

All bay area species are in <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/779781-Limnia">section Limnia</a>.

<b>Caution: IDs uncertain</b>

Plants have a rosette of basal leaves which may be green to red, prostrate to erect.  The leaf blades may be inconspicuous, making the basal leaves look thoroughly unleaflike.  They may instead look very stem-like.  <b>Be sure to isolate and highlight the basal leaves for photography.</b>

Plants have exactly 2 opposite cauline leaves per stem, often fused or partially fused into a disc.

Key features:
. shape of basal leaves
. shape of cauline leaves
. number of bracts per inflorescence
. flower petal length

==candy flower:C. sibirica
color:white
. <b>cauline leaves are substantial but not fused</b>
. <b>bracts throughout inflorescence</b>, 1 for every 1--2 flowers
.. all others have only a single bract, below the lowest flower
. corolla pink

==gypsum springbeauty:C. gypsophiloides
color: white, pink
. <b>cauline leaves are quite small and +- linear</b> [info from CalPhotos; Jepson is much less descriptive]
. <b>petals 5--8 mm</b>
. corolla pink

# I originally had "crabclaw serpentine springbeauty" for ssp. exigua,
# presumably from iNaturalist.  However, iNaturalist has deleted this name
# (and any others that might have existed, leaving no common names for this
# subspecies), and this name gets zero hits on Google.
#
# I originally had "serpentine springbeauty" for ssp. glauca, presumably
# also from iNaturalist.  However, iNaturalist now only has
# "glaucous springbeauty".
#
# Calscape lists "serpentine springbeauty" as the common name for the species
# and both subspecies, and Calflora also lists that as an option for them all.
#
# Confusingly, Calscape lists alternative names for ssp. exigua but not for
# ssp. glauca, while Calflora lists some of those alternative names for
# ssp. exigua but others for ssp. glauca.  So that's a mess that I choose
# to ignore.
#
# In light of all that, I've settled on the common names listed below.
#
# iNaturalist has "pale springbeauty" as the primary species name (with many
# other options), which is fine.
