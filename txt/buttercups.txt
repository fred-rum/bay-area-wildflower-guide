<h2>Difficult buttercups</h2>

These buttercups all have <= 7 petals and potentially grow erect from land.  Jepson distinguishes these buttercups by fruit.  If you find any with fruit, consult Jepson.  Here I've tried to distinguish them by flower and leaf characteristics.  They are sorted here by petal length.
