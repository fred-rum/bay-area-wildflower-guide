sci:Iris spp.
x:hist/rare

iNaturalist's Seek app often suggests "oregon iris (<i>Iris tenax</i>)", but it is not naturalized in the bay area.

Key features:
. perianth tube shape and length (measured from base of stamens to top of ovary [which can be hard to determine])
. basal leaf width
. cauline leaves similar to basal leaves or to bracts [spathes, or non-spathes?] (short, bract-like, inflated, and overlapping with only the tips free)
. stigma shape
. spathes opposite or alternate (the spathes are the lowest bracts when there is more than one flower per inflorescence)

Parts of an iris labeled: <a href="https://www.pacificcoastiris.org/wildiris_three_main_groups.php">one</a>, <a href="https://leonineiris.com/l9ie_partsoftheirisflower.php">two</a>.<br>

The perianth tube is measured from the base of the stamens to the top of the ovary.  (<a href="http://www.pacificcoastiris.org/spcni_downloads/spcni.v09.1.fall1981.pdf">How to measure</a> iris parts starting on page 11.)

The leaves are narrower, straighter, glossier, and deeper green than {-wavy-leafed soap plant}.
