sci:Ceanothus spp.
x:hist/rare

Key features:
. twig color, whether twigs are rigid or flexible, ridged or not, angled near tip or not
. leaves opposite or alternate
. number of ribs from base of leaf
. leaf adaxial, abaxial, and margin characteristics

Flower color is not a good diagnostic.

All leaves are dark green or dull green adaxially and paler abaxially.
