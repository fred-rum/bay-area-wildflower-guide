Edibility: Contains saponins, and saponins make things taste like soap <a href="https://www.picturethisai.com/wiki/Symphoricarpos_mollis.html">[source]</a>.  Sapopins are also toxic, although poorly absorbed.  It would take many kilos of fruit from this plant in order to produce toxic symptoms <a href="https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphoricarpos+albus">[source]</a>.  Not to be confused with a tastier creeping snowberry, <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i>.
