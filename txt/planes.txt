Jepson doesn't include {-american sycamore}, so I'm using <a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/difference-between-california-sycamore-american-sycamore-71047.html">another reference</a> for distinguishing it.

==western sycamore:P. racemosa
color:other
. leaf lobes >= &frac13; blade
.. terminal lobe much longer than wide
. 3--7 fruits in a crooked arrangement along a stalk

==london plane:P. Xhispanica
sci_F: n/a
. leaf lobes < &frac13; blade
.. terminal lobe generally as long as wide
. Flora of North America believes that it is <a href="http://floranorthamerica.org/Platanus_occidentalis">not naturalized</a>

==american sycamore:P. occidentalis
sci_j:n/a
. leaf lobes generally shallower than for {-western sycamore}, but it can vary among leaves on a tree and depending on condition
. usually only a single fruit per stalk
