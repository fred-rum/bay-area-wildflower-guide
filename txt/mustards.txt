Many ID tips from the iNaturalist forum^https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/brassica-nigra-and-hirschfeldia-incana-why-so-many-mistakes/24528 .

Find some fruits!  The more mature, the better.

==cabbages and mustards:genus Brassica
. basal leaves in a rosette
. <b>sepals generally erect to ascending</b>
. distal cauline leaves sessile
. very common
. leaf feels "scratchy"; compare to {-Hirschfeldia incana}

==genus Rhamphospermum
. very common

==white mustard:Sinapis alba
genus:n/a
x:ca
. basal leaves not in a rosette
. sepals spreading
. stigma 2-lobed
. fruit is valved proximally, indehiscent distally
.. fruit linear, glabrous
.. <b>valves have 3--7 prominent veins each</b>
.. distal segment is at least as long as the proximal segment, flattened
.. seeds spheric
. rare
. very similar to {-charlock}
. some buds have the sepals folden to make them look like to make a cross-shaped dome; also true of {-charlock}

==shortpod mustard:Hirschfeldia incana
color: yellow
x:any
genus: n/a
. <b>basal leaves in a rosette</b>
. <b>sepals spreading to reflexed</b> [but the few existing photos indicate erect or ascending, rarely spreading, never reflexed]
. stigma not lobed
. cauline leaves dentate to pinnately lobed, petioled or sessile
. valves have 3 veins each (or rarely more)
. seeds ovoid
. very common
. fruit is valved proximally, indehiscent distally
.. fruit linear, glabrous
.. <b>valves have 3--7 prominent veins each</b>
.. distal segment is conical
.. distal segment has 1 or 2 seeds
. leaf feels "fuzzy"; compare to {-genus Brassica}
. vegetation is dull gray-green; compare to {-black mustard}
. leaves have regular lobes with a terminal lobe not much wider than the side lobes
.. many more basal lobes than {-black mustard}
. most leaves are in the basal rosette; compare to {-black mustard}
. fruit does not have a square cross section; flattened at least in the upper part?
. sepals and buds are hairy; compare to {-black mustard}
. no leaves clasp the stem
. open flowers often overtop flower buds


==genus Sisymbrium
