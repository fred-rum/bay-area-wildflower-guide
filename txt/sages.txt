Many sages seem to be in developed areas as if garden planted.  I've
included only those that have at least one observation in a wild area
that I frequent.

==black sage:S. mellifera
color: white
. shrub, 1--2 m
. corolla tube 5.5--9 mm, white to pale blue or lavender (rarely, pale rose), upper lip 2-lobed
. stamens, style +- exserted
. common

==white sage:S. apiana
color:white
. subshrub, 1--2 m
. corolla tube 12--22 mm, white and lavender, upper lip < 2 mm, lower lip 4--5 mm, upcurved
. stamens, style exserted
