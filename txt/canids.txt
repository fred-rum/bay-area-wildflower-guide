Canines are generally easily distinguished by sight.  Tracks are harder, especially when domesticated dogs are considered.

Canines have one front lobe and two rear lobes in their heel pads, whereas cats have two front lobes and three rear lobes in each heel pad.  [<a href="https://sciencing.com/difference-between-bobcat-coyote-tracks-6526801.html">source</a>]  Some canines are more or less likely to leave none#claw impressions depending on conditions; cats never leave none#claw impressions.  Tracks made by canine hind feet are smaller than those left by front feet.
