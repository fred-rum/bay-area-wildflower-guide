Anne Parsons has collected <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/journal/truthseqr/39654-brush-rabbit-vs-desert-cottontail">many obeservations</a> showing the differences in features. The <a href="http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/MTYrabbits.html">Creagus</a> website has additional ID tips for less apparent features.
