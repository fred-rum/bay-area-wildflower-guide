<h2>Leafy stems</h2>

# iNaturalist has Cytisus as "brooms" but Genista as nothing.
# That's just confusing, and without distinguishing common names for both,
# I'd rather have common names for neither.
# However, to avoid any potential complaint about Cytisus, I give
# it an alternative common name of "monkeyflowers".
# And because Genista might as well match, I do the same for it.
