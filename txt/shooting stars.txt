The anthers of Shooting stars are fused in pairs, with connective tissue between and covering them, often coming to a point between the tips of each anther pair.  The connective tissue widens to cover the anthers toward the proximal end, where all filaments are often fused to form a filament tube.

Jepson has produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw6AcwbeG8s">video</a> showing differences between the bay area species, along with high quality photos.  Another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChYxUKS2RtY">video</a> describes the relevant botanical terms in more detail.
