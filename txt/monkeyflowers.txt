# iNaturalist has Erythranthe as "monkeyflowers" but Diplacus as nothing.
# That's just confusing, and without distinguishing common names for both,
# I'd rather have common names for neither.
# However, to avoid any potential complaint about Erythranthe, I give
# it an alternative common name of "monkeyflowers".
# And because Diplacus might as well match, I do the same for it.
