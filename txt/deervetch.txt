sci:Acmispon spp.
asci:genus Ottleya
x:!rare

Key features:
. stem erect, ascending, decumbent, or prostrate; woody (but green) or not
. number of leaflets per leaf, <b>leaflets hairy or not</b>
. number of flowers per leaf axil
. peduncle << 1 cm or > 1 cm
. calyx lobe length relative to tube
. corolla color
. wings >, <, or +- = keel

See also <a href="https://montereywildflowers.com/fabaceae-acmispon/">Monterey County Wildflowers</a>.

Jepson describes for many deervetch species whether the wings are +- greater or less than the keel.  I assume that this measures their relative length, but the supposed differences are indistinguishable in CalPhotos.
