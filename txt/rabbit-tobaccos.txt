I need to re-evaluate all of my observations now that I have some idea what to look for.

Each head is composed of only disc flowers surrounded by +- white phyllaries.  Staminate or bisexual flowers are at the center surrounded by a larger number of peripheral pistillate flowers.

<b>The involucre is cylindric to generally urn-shaped.</b>  Compare to {-pearly everlasting}.

Key features:
. stem stalked-glandular or not, glabrous or proximally glabrous or +- tomentose
. leaf clasping or not, decurrent or not, tomentose or glandular or not on each leaf face, flat or wavy
. inflorescence shape
. head shape and colors
