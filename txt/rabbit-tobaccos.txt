I need to re-evaluate all of my observations now that I have some idea what to look for.

Each head is composed of only disc flowers surrounded by +- white phyllaries.  <b>The involucre is cylindric to generally urn-shaped.</b>  Compare to {-pearly everlasting}.

Key features:
. stem stalked-glandular or not, glabrous or proximally glabrous or +- tomentose
. leaf clasping or not, decurrent or not, tomentose or glandular or not on each leaf face, flat or wavy
. inflorescence shape
. head shape and colors

color: white
. <b>Stem stalked-glandular, sometimes glabrous</b>
. Leaves generally not crowded
. Leaf base +- clasping or not, decurrent 0--15 mm
. Leaf faces generally green, stalked-glandular, sometimes +- tomentose
. Leaf flat or margin slightly curled under, sometimes wavy
. inflorescence flat-topped or rounded
. phyllaries in 7--10 series, white to pink
. very common

. Leaf margin curled under and closely wavy
. Inflorescence in panicle-like cluster
. <b>phyllaries generally +- pink</b> [it's distinctive in CalPhotos]
. common

==fragrant everlasting:P. beneolens

==cottonbatting plant:P. stramineum
color: white
. Stem not glandular, loosely to densely tomentose
. Leaves +- crowded
. Leaf base +- clasping, generally not decurrent
. Leaf faces loosely persistently gray-tomentose, not glandular
. Leaf flat or margin slightly curled under
. Inflorescence dense, 1--2 cm diam or +- cyme-like

https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0216+0803
. Stem not glandular, <b>sometimes +- woody near base, proximally tomentose to glabrous</b>, but always tomentose near heads
. Leaves not crowded
. Leaf base clasping, not decurrent
. adaxial leaf face +- bright green, tomentose or not, <b>densely stalked-glandular</b>
. abaxial leaf face generally white-tomentose
. Leaf flat or margin slightly curled under, often wavy
. Inflorescence +- flat-topped
. rare

==jersey cudweed:P. luteoalbum

==feltleaf everlasting:P. microcephalum
. Stem not glandular, tomentose
. Leaves crowded or not
. Leaf base clasping or not, decurrent 3--10 mm or not

. Inflorescence loose, flat-topped to panicle-like cluster
. <b>narrow heads</b>
. phyllaries in 4--6 series
. disk flowers 5--9
. stem 3--5 mm diam near base
. "Characterized by stems commonly stiffly erect and slightly zigzag distally, relatively thick (3--5 mm diam near base), and closely gray-tomentose, leaves oblanceolate, sessile, sometimes clasping, not decurrent, and weakly 2-colored."
