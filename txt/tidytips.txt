<h3>ray petals may be yellow with white at the tips</h3>

==tidy tips:L. platyglossa
color: yellow
. ray petals are mostly yellow, but usually with white at the tips
. <b>glandular</b> (e.g. on involucre, or as spots on peduncle)
. phyllary tip (extending up the petal) +- as long as its folded base [example,2]
. <b>stem generally not purple-streaked</b> [or <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/22174576">spotted</a>]
. proximal leaves lobed +- 1/2 to midvein
. scattered all around the bay

==woodland tidytips:L. gaillardioides
color: yellow
. most have only yellow; only some have white or pale yellow tips
. <b>glandular</b>
. phyllary tip (extending up the petal) much shorter than its folded base [example,2] [CalPhotos shows at least one exception, but it may be misidentified]
. <b>stem purple-streaked</b>, ascending, not strictly erect [dunno what this means; they look erect enough on CalPhotos]
. proximal leaves serrate or lobed "< or > 1/2 to midvein"
. scattered, generally *not* in woods

==smooth tidytips:L. chrysanthemoides
. ray petals are mostly yellow, but with white or pale yellow at the tips
. <b>glandless</b> (e.g. on involucre)
. stem not purple-streaked
. proximal leaves often lobed +- to midvein
