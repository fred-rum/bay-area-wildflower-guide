The parts of a larkspur flower are described in the {-larkspur glossary}.

figure:larkspur
figure:larkspur spur

Key features:
. number of flowers and whether the oldest (lowest) open-flowered pedicels are > 25 mm and > 2 &times; youngest
. color of sepals, reflexed or not (especially lower sepals)
. multiple stems or just one
. stem length, hairy or +- glabrous and ridged or not (especially at base)
. length of lower petal blades, and width of petal lobes
. proximal petiole (leaf stem) hairs > 0.5 mm & straight, spreading, white, or [maybe] not
. leaf hairy adaxially or not, abaxially or not

There may be additional useful features that I haven't pulled from Jepson eFlora.

==red larkspur:D. nudicaule
color: red
. sepals forward-pointing, <b>scarlet to orange-red (dull yellow)</b>, lateral sepals 8--16 mm, spur 12--34 mm
. petals +- glabrous to naked eye
. stem 15--50 cm (--125), generally glabrous
. common in bay area
See also {-california fuchsia}, which does not have a spur extending perpendicular to the pedicel and has much longer filaments.  There is also a scarlet larkspur (<i>Delphinium cardinale</i>), but it isn't found in the bay area.

==california larkspur:D. californicum

. sepals forward-pointing, +- lavender or +- green-white depending on subspecies [maybe]
. leaf lobes 3--15, 5--<b>60</b> mm wide, tips +- sharply cut
. common in bay area

. leaf generally basal, +- glabrous adaxially, generally +- puberulent abaxially and on margins
.. generally 5 lobes > 50% to petiole; lobes occasionally > 6 mm wide
. <b>lower petal blades 6-11 mm</b> (longer than {-D. patens})
. scattered around bay area

==royal larkspur:D. variegatum
color: purple
. <b>stem generally < 50 cm, base hairy, base not longitudinally ridged</b> (unlike {-D. hesperium})
. <b>flowers on main axis generally < 10</b>
. pedicels +- ascending, 6--74 mm, 10--25 mm apart, generally puberulent
. if <= 6 flowers on main axis, oldest open-flowered pedicel generally < 25 mm or < 2 &times; youngest
. <b>proximal petiole hairs > 0.5 mm, straight, spreading, white, and some not</b>
. flower spur 10--19 mm, straight or down-curved < 3 mm at tip
. sepals generally dark royal-blue (white or lavendar)
.. lateral sepals 10--25 mm
. lower petals have sparse marginal hairs ^https://montereywildflowers.com/ranunculaceae-larkspur/
. leaf generally on proximal 1/3 of stem; lobes 3--15, generally overlapping
. scattered around bay area

==foothill larkspur:D. hesperium
. <b>stem 40--80 cm</b> (10--120), <b>base generally ridged</b> (unlike {-D. variegatum})
. <b>flowers 5--100</b> [CalPhotos shows them all with similar pedicel lengths, not longer at the bottom]
. proximal petiole hairs are unknowable
. blades of lower petals hairier adaxially (inner lobe) than abaxially (outer lobe)
. sepals spreading, not reflexed, dark blue-purple or pale depending on subspecies
.. <b>sepals shorter than many other larkspurs</b>
. pedicels ascending at < 45&deg; angle [from vertical? angle at tip?], puberulent
. leaf adaxially +- glabrous, abaxially puberulent, prominently veined

. abaxial veins not prominent ^http://floranorthamerica.org/Delphinium_hesperium_subsp._hesperium
. Coe, near Cowell, and lots in Pinnacles
