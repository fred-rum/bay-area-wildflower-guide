Taxons that create galls are listed in their normal taxonomic locations, but I've also collected them here for easier browsing.
<p>
The most popular references for galls is
Ron Russo's Field Guide to Plant Galls of California (2007) and
his Field Guide to Plant Galls of California and Other Western States (2021).
<br>
A good online reference is Joyce Gross's web pages for
<a href="https://joycegross.com/galls_ca_oak.php">oak calls</a> and
<a href="http://joycegross.com/galls_ca_nonoak.php">non-oak galls</a>.

The Bioblitz Club also has PDF brochures for

Nancy Asquith has tons of <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/california-plants-with-mystery-galls/journal/39523-california-galls-a-host-plant-list-with-links">additional links</a> on iNaturalist.
