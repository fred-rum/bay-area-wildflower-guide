# There are no properties here because every taxon under this one
# gets its needed properties from its proper Linnaean hierarchy,
# and we don't need any overrides for galls in particular.

Taxons that create galls are listed in their normal taxonomic locations, but I've also collected them here for easier browsing.  In addition, rather than organizing them into the traditional clades, this page organizes galls based on host and gall location on the host.

The most popular references for galls are
Ron Russo's Field Guide to Plant Galls of California and Other Western States (2007) and
his <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691205762/plant-galls-of-the-western-united-states">Plant Galls of the Western States</a> (2021).
