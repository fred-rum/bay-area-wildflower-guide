Jepson doesn't describe well how to distinguish these.

==brewer's ragwort:P. breweri
color: yellow
. generally 1 stem
. glabrous or sparsely hairy when young
. 15--50+ heads
. green phyllary tips
. phyllaries glabrous

==widehead groundsel:P. eurycephala var. eurycephala
species: widehead groundsel
. 1 or several clustered stems
. glabrous or densely tomentose
. 5--30+ heads
. phyllary tips sometimes yellow

Although iNaturalist has a few observations of other species in the bay area, none of them are research grade.
