There are other sand spurries in the bay area, but I'm hesitant to include them when the differences are so inconspicuous.

Jepson lists the lower main stem diameter as a distinguishing characteristic, but my experience is that it is wrong.  It is therefore unclear how to distinguish species except by location.  FNA says that "Spergularia is a difficult genus in which emphasis on seed characters appears necessary."
