. forms on the upper leaf surfaces of {-california wild rose}

==teardrop gall wasp:Diplolepis inconspicuis
bug:n/a
gall:1467
. forms in place of plant#buds on branches of {-california wild rose}

==n/a:Periclistus pirata
bug:n/a
gall:2419
. takes over the galls of {-nodular gall wasp} and thus indirectly forms within branches of {-california wild rose}

==nodular gall wasp:Diplolepis nodulosa
bug:n/a
gall:1401
. forms within branches of {-california wild rose}
. parasitized by {-Periclistus pirata}
