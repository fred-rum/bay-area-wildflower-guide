Per BugGuide, "scale colour and distribution variable, but often diagnostic".  After clicking through a number of species, I agree that the pattern is indeed diagnostic.

Also from BugGuide: "larvae scavenge on accumulated fur, feathers, skin flakes, dead insects, etc. keratine- or chitin-rich materials; adults feed on pollen on flowers."
