Another species in the genus, Ageratina altissima, causes milk sickness when dairy animals eat the plant and the toxin accumulates in the milk.  Before the cause was determined, this killed thousands of midwesterners in the early 1800's, including Nancy Lincoln, mother of Abraham Lincoln.^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_sickness It is unclear to me whether other species are incapable of the same feat, or if modern grazing care simply prevent them from having the opportunity.
