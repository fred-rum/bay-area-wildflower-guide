sci:Dichelostemma spp.
x:rare

Key features:
. staminode color, leaning in or out [technically, it's a filament appendage, but it looks like a staminode]
. perianth tube narrowed above ovary or not

The defining difference is the number of stamens, but I can't count them without taking apart the flower.

See also the similar {-blue dicks}.
