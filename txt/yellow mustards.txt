This page describes the most common mustard relatives with yellow flowers that are 1+ inch in diameter.  Smaller and rarer flowers are not covered here.

ID tips are generally from Jepson eFlora unless otherwise stated.

ID tips marked [IF] from the <a href="https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/brassica-nigra-and-hirschfeldia-incana-why-so-many-mistakes/24528">iNaturalist forum</a>.

A basal rosette may be obscured by live or dead vegetation, or the rosette itself may have withered away.  The absence of a basal rosette doesn't seem to be a useful distinguishing characteristic.

The fruit of all species is linear and generally splits into two valves along most of its length, but with an indehiscent terminal segment.  Young fruit may be indehiscent throughout[?].

Key features:
. fruits appressed to stem or not
. fruit shape (the more mature, the better): side view and cross section
. plant height
. hairy lower stem or not
. basal leaves: present as a rosette or not, lobe pattern
. cauline leaves: many or few
. flower bud: overtopping flowers or not, hairy or not

==field mustard:Brassica rapa
. fruit not appressed
.. fruit 3--8 cm long, 2--4 mm wide
.. terminal segment tapered [MCW], 8--22 mm long
. stem 30--100 cm
. few or no hairs
. basal leaves may be pinnately lobed, with the terminal leaflet being the largest [MCW]
. middle and <b>distal cauline leaves</b> sessile, base lobed, <b>generally clasping</b>
. open flowers often overtop flower buds
. very common
. there are other {-genus Brassica}, although these are rare

==shortpod mustard:Hirschfeldia incana
color: yellow
x:any
genus: n/a
. fruit appressed to stem
.. fruit does not have a square cross section; flattened at least in the upper part?

.. terminal segment conical, 3--6 mm long, 1--2 seeded
. basal leaves in a rosette, pinnately lobed
. cauline leaves dentate to pinnately lobed, petioled or sessile, not clasping
. most leaves are in the basal rosette; compare to {-black mustard}
. leaf feels "fuzzy" [basal or cauline?] [IF]
. vegetation is dull gray-green; compare to {-black mustard} [IF]
. leaves have regular lobes with a terminal lobe not much wider than the side lobes
.. many more basal lobes than {-black mustard}
. open flowers often overtop flower buds
.. sepals and buds are hairy [IF]; compare to {-black mustard}
. very common

==black mustard:Rhamphospermum nigrum
. fruit appressed to stem, or at least partially so
.. may be less appressed later in the season [IF]

.. fruit 1--2.5 cm long, 2--3 mm wide
.. valves have 1 vein each [HPB]
.. terminal segment 2--5 mm, thin and seedless
. stem 30--<b>200 cm</b>
.. stem hairs unclear: hairy only higher up [MCW] or stiff hairy below [Jepson]
. basal leaves are pinnately lobed, more or less toothed [MCW]
. cauline leaves are smaller [MCW] with a tapered base, not clasping
. stem is much more leafy than {-shortpod mustard} [IF]
. vegetation is glossy dark green; compare to {-shortpod mustard}
. flower buds often overtop open flowers [IF]
.. sepals and buds are glabrous [IF]; compare to {-shortpod mustard}
. very common, but also commonly IDed by mistake [IF]

==charlock:Rhamphospermum arvense
. fruit not appressed
. fruit linear: 2--4.5 cm long, 2.5--3.5 mm wide, glabrous

.. terminal segment is conical, inflated around 1 or 2 seeds [HPB] or 0 or 1 seeds [Jepson]
. stem 20--100 cm (occasionally much taller)
.. stem is much more hairy than {-black mustard} [IF], but occasionally glabrous [Jepson]
. basal leaves not in a rosette
. cauline leaves short-petioled, dentate
. uncommon
