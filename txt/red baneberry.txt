sci:Actaea rubra

genus: baneberries and cohoshes
x:ca

The species has genetic variations (i.e. mutations) that produce two distinct forms, although individual plants with the same form aren't necessarily more closely related.  Note the potential confusion with the eastern species, white baneberry, which also has red-fruited and white-fruited forms.

==white-fruited red baneberry:f. neglecta

Edibility: "The common name makes reference to a potent poison concentrated in the fruits." ^https://baynature.org/article/berries-of-the-forest/ "Symptoms include burning of mouth and throat, salivation, severe stomach cramps, headache, diarrhea, dizziness and hallucinations." ^https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=acru2
