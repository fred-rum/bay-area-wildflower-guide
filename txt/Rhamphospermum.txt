x:ca

Genus described in Harvard Papers in Botany, June 2021 <a href="https://huh.harvard.edu/files/herbaria/files/hpb_volume26_number1_lores.pdf">[PDF]</a>.

Both species are very similar to {-field mustard}.

==black mustard:R. nigrum
sci_fpj:Brassica nigra
color: yellow
. <b>basal leaves in a rosette</b>
. <b>sepals generally erect to ascending</b>
. stem 30--200 cm, generally branched distally
. basal and lower cauline leaves pinnately lobed, serrate-dentate
. <b>distal cauline leaves</b> smaller, sessile, <b>base tapered, not lobed</b>
. petals 7--11(13) mm
. fruit is valved proximally, indehiscent distally
.. <b>valves have 1 vein each</b>
.. the distal segment has no seeds
. very common
. vegetation is glossy dark green; compare to {-shortpod mustard}
. leafy stem; compare to {-shortpod mustard}
. fruit has 4 raised ribs, giving each a square cross section
. fruits are appressed to stem, or at least partially so; compare to {-charlock}
. sepals/buds are glabrous; compare to {-shortpod mustard}
. no leaves clasp the stem
. flower buds often overtop open flowers

==charlock:R. arvense
sci_fpj:Sinapis arvensis
color: yellow
. <b>basal leaves not in a rosette</b>
. <b>sepals spreading</b>
. stigma 2-lobed
. cauline leaves short-petioled, dentate
. fruit is valved proximally, indehiscent distally
.. fruit linear, glabrous
.. <b>valves have 3--7 prominent veins each</b>
.. distal segment is much shorter than the proximal segment, conical
.. distal segment has 1 or 2 seeds (or sometimes 0, according to Jepson)
. uncommon
. very similar to {-white mustard}
. fruits are not appressed to stem; compare to {-black mustard}
. fruit does not have an obviously square cross section
. stem is much more hairy than {-black mustard}
. leaves are often much less lobed than {-black mustard}
. some buds have the sepals folden to make them look like to make a cross-shaped dome; also true of {-white mustard}
