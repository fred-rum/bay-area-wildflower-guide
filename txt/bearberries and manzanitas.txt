sci:Arctostaphylos spp.
x:Calflora lists 67 species and subspecies of manzanita in the bay area.  I've discarded the rare ones, but it's still tough to distinguish among those that remain.

Key features:
. burls at base of trunk or not
. leaf color and features <b>on each side</b>
. leaf clasping or not
. leaf sticky or not
. shape of nascent inflorescence bracts
. inflorescence shape
. flower parts in 4s or 5s
. ovary/fruit features and diameter

Parasitized by {-manzanita leafgall aphid} and {-genus Exobasidium}.

<h2>burl; leaves same on both sides</h2>

<h2>no burl; leaves different on each side</h2>

==glossyleaf manzanita:A. sensitiva
. plant erect, 1--2 m

. {-Arctostaphylos sensitiva} was previously considered a subspecies of {-Arctostaphylos nummularia}, so e.g. CalFlora is confusing
