==manzanita leafgall aphid:Tamalia coweni
bug:214155
gall:2793
. forms on midribs or edges of leaves of many species of {-Arctostaphylos}, including {-bearberry}, but not {-big berry manzanita}
.. galls cause significant swelling and distortion of the leaf edge
.. compare to {-Exobasidium arctostaphyli}, which causes only a minor blister

==n/a:Exobasidium arctostaphyli
gall:4400
. forms bright red blisters on the leaf surfaces of {-bearberries and manzanitas}, turning glaucous on the inner side
.. blisters cause only a minor buckling of the leaf surface
.. compare to {-genus Tamalia}, which cause signifant swelling and distortion of the leaf edge
