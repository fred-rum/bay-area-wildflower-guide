If the stamen and ovary colors differ, <a href-"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/40189428">some</a> on iNaturalist claim that the ovary color determines the species, but Jerpson says the anther color determines, and <a href="http://floranorthamerica.org/Trillium_chloropetalum">FNA</a> simply says that a range of intergrade hybrids exist.  The direction of anther dehiscence may be the correct identifier, but I can't tell the difference in photos.
