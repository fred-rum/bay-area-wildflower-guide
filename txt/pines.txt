sci:genus Pinus
x:rare
taxon_id: 47561

Key features:
. number of leaves [needles] per bundle
. leaf rigid or flexible and drooping
. seed cone color
. proximal seed cone scale tips recurved and elongated or not
. seed cone scale tips with knob angled or rounded, < or > 2 cm
. seed cones persistent on stems for many years or deciduous

All local pines are "hard pines" (subgenus Pinus).  For these, the
(brown) sheath for the leaf bundle is retained, not deciduous.

CalFlora lists many pines in the bay area, but for now I will confine
this list mostly to the less rare ones (> 25 CalFlora records).
