sci:Geranium spp.
x:hist/rare

Leaves are palmately lobed to divided, except for {-herb robert}, {-little-robin}, and {-canary island geranium}.

When counting segments, it may be easiest to count the mid-rib veins radiating from a common point.  Unless specified otherwise, each segment is further palmately lobed and/or toothed in outline, although the veins are pinnate.

Except where specified otherwise, geraniums have 2 flowers per inflorescence.  In many cases, one flower is open while the other one is closed.

All species may be +- glandular anywhere.  This is never a distinguishing feature.

Key features:
. root thickness
. petal length
. anther color [consider brushing off pollen to reveal]
. stigma lobe color
. [most that most anther/stigma colors documented here are sampled from CalPhotos and may not be accurate or reflect the full color range]
. leaf shape and width (across all segments)
. stem hair pattern
. if fruit is present, tip and base shapes can be diagnostic

<h2>rounded petal tips</h2>

==herb robert:G. robertianum
color: purple
. stem hairs +- sparse
. leaf blade 3.5--10 cm wide, <b>divided > 90% to base or midrib</b>
