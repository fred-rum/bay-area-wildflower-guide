Man, there are so many bay area scorpionweeds.  Everything is potentially a key feature.

Key features:
. woody taproot or branched caudex (perennial) or slender taproot (annual)
. cauline leaves or only basal
. leaflets toothed, lobed, entire, or 0 (basal, cauline, or distal)
. number of leaflet lobes, shape of lobes
. calyx lobe length, hairy or not
. corolla color, size, shape
. number and shape of seed

==mountain phacelia:P. imbricata
color: white, other
. corolla white with a mix of white and brown filaments and anthers
. leaf blade 5--15 cm, dissected (distal sometimes entire)
.. leaves mostly basal

==distant phacelia:P. distans
color: pale purple, white, other
. corolla pale purple, beige (cream with brown streaks), or white
. corolla throat with dark purple spots below petals (except on pure white corolla)

==shade phacelia:P. nemoralis
color: pale purple, other
. corolla white with a mix of white and brown filaments and anthers
.. jepson thinks the corolla is green-white or yellow-white
... if they mean white with a slight shading, it is plausible
. leaf blade 4--15 cm
.. proximal-most leaves generally compound with 3--7 leaflets
.. distal-most leaves often entire

==california phacelia:P. californica
color: pale purple, other
. corolla purple to pale purple (rarely white)
. leaf blade 5--20 cm
.. generally compound (sometimes dissected) with 3--7 leaflets
.. mostly basal
.. distal-most leaves often entire

==stinging phacelia:P. malvifolia
color: white, cream, other
. leaves, stems, calyx lobes with long stiff hairs
.. other phacelia have similar hairs, so the distinction may be difficult to perceive
. leaf 2--14 cm including petiole
.. proximal leaves lobed to compound with 3 segments which are also toothed or irregularly lobed
.. distal leaves generally toothed or lobed
