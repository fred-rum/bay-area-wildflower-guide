sci:Quercus
x:rare

CalFlora lists many oaks in the bay area, but for now I will confine
this list to the less rare ones (> 50 CalFlora records).
See also the related {-tanoak}.

Key features:
. bark color
. acorn cap scales thin or thick
.. "Thin" means that the cap conforms closely to the shape of the underlying nut, rather than being distinctly puffed out.
. nut shell hairy, woolly, or not inside
. leaf shape, colors on top and bottom
.. "Adaxially convex" means that the leaf is correspondingly abaxially concave.
.. Be careful when checking the leaf shape because the tip is considered separately.  E.g. a leaf that is "roundish" may actually be lanceolate.
