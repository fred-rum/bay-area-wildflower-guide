x:ba

These species parasitize {-manzanitas} and others in the {-heath family}.

==azalea gall:Exobasidium vaccinii
. forms blisters on the surface of {-manzanitas} leaves
.. blisters cause only a minor buckling of the leaf surface, unlike {-manzanita leafgall aphid}, which causes signifant swelling and distortion of the leaf edge.
. may sometimes also disrupt stem growth, although I haven't found a description of the range of forms of this damage

==Exobasidium vaccinii-uliginosi
<b>Caution: ID unsure</b>
. causes the end of a stem and its associated leaves to turn red
