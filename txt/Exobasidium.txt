sci:genus Exobasidium
# unknown number of additional species, described or undescribed

This genus parasitizes {-bearberries and manzanitas} and others in the {-heath family}.

Ron Russo's popular reference for California galls lists {-Exobasidium vaccinii} as forming galls on numerous plant hosts.  However, discussions on iNaturalist have cast doubt on this interpretation.  A timeline:
. <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/3154527#page/42/mode/1up">1885 Casey</a> (free) briefly describes {-Exobasidium arctostaphyli} on {-bearberries and manzanitas}.
. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2990117.pdf">1915 Burt</a> (free) lumps galls on many hosts into {-Exobasidium vaccinii}.
. <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/b59-052">1959 Savile</a> (req. subscription) mostly agrees with Burt, but retains {-Exobasidium arctostaphyli} as a distinct entity.
. <a href="https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=PASCAL82X0050208">1981 Nannfeldt</a> (citation only) proposes that {-Exobasidium vaccinii} is found only on lingonbery (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).
. more recent studies tend to agree, e.g. as described in the introduction to <a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2012/nrs_2012_kennedy_001.pdf">2012 Kennedy</a> (free).
. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/1399323/history">2022 Schwab</a> adds {-Exobasidium arctostaphyli} to iNaturalist, and Asquith in particular starts adding this ID to many observations.
.. Schwab believes that although the original 1885 description includes infections of both leaves and young shoots, only leaf infections should be included in {-Exobasidium arctostaphyli}.
.. Infections of whole shoots should instead be identified only as {-Exobasidium} until properly researched.

==n/a:Exobasidium arctostaphyli
. forms bright red blisters on the surface of {-bearberries and manzanitas} leaves, turning glaucous on the inner side
.. blisters cause only a minor buckling of the leaf surface
.. compare to {-manzanita leafgall aphid}, which causes signifant swelling and distortion of the leaf edge
. see above for discussion

==azalea gall:Exobasidium vaccinii
. parasitizes only lingonbery (Vaccinium vitis-idaea)
. see above for discussion

==n/a:Exobasidium vaccinii-uliginosi
<b>Caution: photo provided for reference, but ID is unsure</b>
. commonly identified on iNaturalist on various plant hosts, but should probably be identified on {-bearberries and manzanitas} only as {-Exobasidium} until properly researched
. see above for discussion
