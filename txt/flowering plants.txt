If an individual flower can have different primary colors (e.g. depending on age), then it is listed under all of those primary colors.  Flowers that are green or brown or are so small as to have indefinite color are grouped under "Other colors".  A primary color is generally defined as the most color on an individual flower.
. If white, green, or brown is mixed with a more vibrant color color, the vibrant color is considered primary.
. If a flower head has a disc and rays, only the primary color of the rays is used.

# Most families in this taxon are autocreated by the 'create' property above.
# There are a few families with key info or other text, so they have explicit
# txt files.
# A few more families need manual attributes, but don't need extra text.
# For those, we declare them as children below.
# Regardless of how each family is created, they're all re-sorted into
# an appropriate order (as long as I don't add any extraneous text in here).
