{beak,beaks,upper lip,upper lips} The corolla's upper lip lobes are fused into a "none#beak" with an open tip.  The stigma is exserted from the tip of the beak (or included).  The angle of the none#beak (hooked or straight) determines the position of the stigma (next to the none#beak or above it)

{lower lip,lower lips} The corolla's lower lip is reduced and may be 3-toothed to -pouched.
