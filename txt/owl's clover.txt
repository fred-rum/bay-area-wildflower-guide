The corolla's upper lip lobes are fused into a "beak" with an open tip.  The stigma is exserted from the tip of the beak (or included).  The angle of the beak (hooked or straight) determines the position of the stigma (next to the beak or above it)

The corolla's lower lip is reduced and may be 3-toothed to -pouched.
