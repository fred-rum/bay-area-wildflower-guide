sci:Lomatium spp.
x:hist

<b>Caution: IDs uncertain.</b>  I don't really have these figured out.  More field observation may be useful.  I should probably also look into fruit characteristics as necessary.

Key features:
. leaf segments few and large or many and small
. stem present beneath compound umbel structure or not
. peduncle distally swollen/inflated or not
. corolla color

[
<h3>Leaf dissected, segments generally many, small, occasionally long but then narrow</h3>
