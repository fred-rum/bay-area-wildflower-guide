sci:Lomatium spp.
x:hist

<b>Caution: IDs uncertain.</b>  I don't really have these figured out.  More field observation may be useful.  I should probably also look into fruit characteristics as necessary.

Key features:
. leaf segments few and large or many and small
. stem present beneath compound umbel structure or not
. peduncle distally swollen/inflated or not
. corolla color

[
<h3>Leaf dissected, segments generally many, small, occasionally long but then narrow</h3>

==woollyfruit desertparsley:L. dasycarpum
color: yellow
. plant generally with a definite stem; cauline leaves 0 or like basal
. corolla [and calyx] tomentose
. [possibly little or no sheathing on cauline leaf petioles, but CalPhotos doesn't show them one way or another]
. <b>leaf segments 2--6 mm, generally linear [nubby]</b>
. pedicels 5--20 mm
. corolla +- green-white or +- purple [or yellow??], tomentose
. common in the Santa Cruz range, uncommon elsewhere

==foothill desert-parsley:L. utriculatum
color: yellow
. plant generally with a definite stem, stem +- leafy

. <b>cauline leaf petioles conspicuously sheathed</b> (<a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=6121+1611+3984+0073">example</a>)
. <b>leaf segments 2--25 mm, generally [distinctly] linear</b>
. pedicels 2--9 mm [which means the flowers are generally more tightly clustered in each inflorescence than in {-woollyfruit desertparsley}]
. corolla yellow, occasionally white in age
. common

color: yellow
. plant generally with a definite stem, stem leaves generally >= 2
