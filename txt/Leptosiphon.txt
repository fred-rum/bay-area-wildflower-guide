There are quite a few Leptosiphon species in the bay area and my IDs thus far have not been good quality.  This page lists some key features, but I don't attempt to replicate the whole Jepson decision tree.  Instead, each flower description includes enough information to (hopefully) confirm an ID hypothesis (with help from CalPhoto).

Key features:
. densely bracted head or not
. calyx position (among bracts or just under corolla)
. calyx & calyx membrane [may be difficult to isolate, so not used in key, but useful for Jepson comparison]
. corolla tube, throat, and lobe colors
. <b>exact corolla lobe length</b>
. leaf lobe length and shape
. stigmas linear or not (Leptosiphons generally have 3 stigmas on 1 style and 5 stamens)

<h2>corolla pediceled above sparse bracts</h2>

I.e. the calyx is at the top of the pedicel and +- cupping the corolla throat.

==serpentine leptosiphon:L. ambiguus
color: pale purple
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0411+0196
. calyx clearly shorter than corolla tube & throat
. corolla:
.. <b>throat maroon</b>
.. lobes yellow or sometimes white blending to pink/pale purple
.. lobes 4--6 mm
. common

==flax-flowered linanthus:L. liniflorus
color: white, pale purple
. calyx slightly shorter than corolla tube & throat
. corolla:
.. throat yellow
.. lobes white, usually with <b>distinct colored veins</b>
.. <b>lobes 8--10 mm</b>
. uncommon

==pygmy linanthus:L. pygmaeus
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+1116+1484
. calyx slightly longer than corolla tube & throat, so <b>calyx lobes tend to poke between petals</b>
. corolla:
.. throat yellow
.. lobes pale purple/white
.. lobes 1--2 mm
. rare

==bolander's linanthus:L. bolanderi
sci_p:Linanthus bolanderi
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0513+1130
. calyx slightly shorter than corolla tube & throat
. corolla:
.. throat generally yellow
.. lobes pink/pale purple/white
.. <b>lobes 2--3 mm</b>
. rare

==large-flowered leptosiphon:L. grandiflorus
sci_p:Linanthus grandiflorus
color: pale purple
. <b>corolla +- sessile above densely bracted head</b> (corolla starts spreading within bracts or not much above)
. <b>corolla 15--30 mm</b>:
.. throat yellow
.. lobes white blending to pink/pale purple/white
. uncommon

[
<h2>corolla salverform above densely bracted heads</h2>

I.e. the calyx is among the bracts, but the corolla has a long tube.

<h3>corolla lobes > 4 mm</h3>

==coast yellow leptosiphon:L. croceus
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0709+0824
. corolla:
.. tube yellow/reddish
.. throat yellow-orange
.. <b>lobes bright yellow, generally with 2 red spots at base</b>
.. lobes 6--8 mm
. leaf lobes 4--7 mm, middle lobe rounded
. very rare

==rose leptosiphon:L. rosaceus
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0413+2490
. corolla:
.. tube pink/yellow
.. throat yellow
.. lobes white, blending to pale purple for a rare subspecies
.. lobes generally 6--9 mm, <b>tip rounded</b>
. leaf lobes 5--12 mm, narrow to linear, rounded
. calyx +- glabrous, nonglandular
. rare

==false babystars:L. androsaceus
sci_p:Linanthus androsaceus
color: pale purple
. corolla:
.. tube reddish
.. throat generally violet at the base and yellow above, but may be white # Monterey wildflowers & Jepson
.. lobes pink/pale purple/white
.. lobes generally > 8 mm, <b>often abruptly soft-pointed</b>
.. stigmas 2--6 mm and well exserted from corolla tube
. leaf lobes 6--30 mm, tips pointed
. calyx ciliate, <b>nonglandular</b>, abaxially generally glabrous
. common
. <b>I tend to distinguish them from {-variable linanthus} by their different petal shape (see photos) and slightly larger corolla diameter</b>

==variable linanthus:L. parviflorus
sci_p:Linanthus parviflorus
color: purple, pale purple, pink, yellow, white
. corolla:
.. tube maroon/pink/yellow
.. throat yellow/orange/purple
.. lobes pink/yellow/purple/white, sometimes with red/purple spots at the base [Jepson says "often", CalPhotos says "almost never"]
.. lobes 4--8 mm
.. stigmas 1--7 mm and strongly exserted from corolla tube
. leaf lobes 2--18 mm, middle lobe tip acute
. calyx densely hairy, <b>glandular</b>
. common
. <b>I tend to distinguish them from {-false babystars} by their different petal shape (see photos) and slightly smaller corolla diameter</b>
