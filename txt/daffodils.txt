There may be other species of daffodils escaped and growing wild in
the bay area, but these are the only ones recognized by Jepson.

==bunch-flowered daffodil:N. tazetta
color:yellow
. inflorescence 3--15-flowered
. perianth parts 1--2 cm
. crown cup-shaped, << perianth parts
. if the perianth and crown are both white, it might be N. papyraceus; Jepson seems unsure

==wild daffodil:N. pseudonarcissus
. inflorescence 1-flowered
. perianth parts 2.5--3.5 cm
. crown tubular, >= perianth parts
