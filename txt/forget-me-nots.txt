Forget-me-nots generally develop in raceme-like cymes, coiled, then +- open in age.  Thus, individuals of the same species can look very different from each other.

Key features:
. calyx tube hairs
. corolla size
. leaf length, width

==broadleaf forget-me-not:M. latifolia
color: pale blue, blue
. calyx tube hairs at least some spreading, some or all hooked
. corolla 5--10 mm diameter, blue (but pink when young)
. leaves roughly 2--3x wider than corollas, roughly 2--3x longer than wide

. calyx tube hairs at least some spreading, some or all hooked
. corolla 1--3 mm diameter, often with different colors for each flower.

. calyx tube hairs appressed, not hooked at tip
. corolla 2--5 mm diameter, blue (but yellow/cream when young)

==wood forget-me-not:M. sylvatica
