Parasitized by {-coffeeberry midrib gall moth}.

Jepson notes that "Frangula californica grows throughout most of California and the subspecies are somewhat separated geographically, but intermediates and variants in California exist between [almost] all the subspecies."  In my experience in the bay area, it is rare to find a plant that is clearly ssp. californica or ssp. tomentella, most having a mix of features.  (Plus, the leaf tip is rarely acute for any of them, so maybe there's another subspecies secretly mixed in.)

Edibility: Raw ripe fruit is "just OK, sweet, a little figgy, not all that interesting", but "the berries have at least some laxative effect" ^https://honest-food.net/california-coffeeberry-edible/ . One commenter claims to have drunk 6 oz. at a time of juiced coffeeberry with no unpleasant side effects ^https://www.cnps.org/life-with-plants/california-coffeeberry-3025#comment-120 . My friend says that the dark red ones taste sweeter than the black ones.
