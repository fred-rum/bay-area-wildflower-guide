Parasitized by {-coffeeberry midrib gall moth}.

Jepson notes that "Frangula californica grows throughout most of California and the subspecies are somewhat separated geographically, but intermediates and variants in California exist between [almost] all the subspecies."  In my experience in the bay area, it is rare to find a plant that is clearly ssp. californica or ssp. tomentella, most having a mix of features.  (Plus, the leaf tip is rarely acute for any of them, so maybe there's another subspecies secretly mixed in.)
