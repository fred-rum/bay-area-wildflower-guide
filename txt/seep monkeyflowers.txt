It could be argued that {-Erythranthe guttata} and {-Erythranthe grandis} are either the same species, or form a species complex that is <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/42209666#activity_comment_b95ba1ff-c3c8-4b07-a62f-0f1388f6b364">insufficiently</a> distinguishable by the current literature.  Guy Nesom's <a href="https://phytoneuron.net/2014Phytoneuron/93PhytoN-SimiolaSisters.pdf">2014 paper</a> claims that the two are morphologically distinct, but it goes on to describe the central California population of E. grandis as "guttata-like."  In any case, this paper doesn't describe what distinguishing features are supposedly present.

I've tried using Jepson's eFlora to distinguish the two species, but it <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/44420130">didn't go well</a>.  Given that I change my ID for this population from year to year, I suspect that any size differences between the two "species" have more to do with the growing conditions than with genetics.  Wikipedia gives an overview of the back-and-forth debate among researchers, which it summarizes as follows: "While E. grandis has recently been raised to the species level, it could also be regarded as a coastal perennial ecotype of E. guttata."

{-Erythranthe grandis} is supposedly more salt tolerant, and most observations are directly on the coast, but Jepson says it can also occur around seeps and creeks, and Calflora does have a few observations inland.
