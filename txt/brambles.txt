sci:Rubus spp.
x:rare

Key features:
. prickle presence and shape
. round or 5-angled stem (pentagonal in cross section)
. sipules shape
. fruit type and color

Although the leaves have general difference, there is enough variety within a species to make them difficult to use as diagnostic tools.  In addition, some of the characteristics described by Jepson cannot be seen in CalPhotos.
