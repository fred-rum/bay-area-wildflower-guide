sci:Malva spp.
x:ca

Mallows have an extra epicalyx cupping the calyx.  (Jepson calls it an involucel with bractlets.)

Key features:
. are epicalyx segments fused to each other at the base?
. are epicalyx segments partially fused to the calyx beneath?
. peel back the calyx segments to view the fruit within.

There is a very good <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qardZB078_-k_KQKszfBrQd3S65-opK/preview">guide</a> to the wild mallows of New Zealand that conveniently encompasses all Bay Area mallows.  Valerio Lazzeri also has a <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/journal/blue_celery/66193-malva-sylvestris-vs-multiflora-vs-nicaeensis-vs-parviflora-key">key to selected mallows</a>.
