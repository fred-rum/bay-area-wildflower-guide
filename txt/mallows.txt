sci:Malva spp.
x:ca

Mallows have an extra epicalyx cupping the calyx.  (Jepson calls it bractlets.)

Peel back the calyx segments to view the fruit within.

There is a very good <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qardZB078_-k_KQKszfBrQd3S65-opK/preview">guide</a> to the wild mallows of New Zealand that conveniently encompasses all California mallows.
