Jepson has a <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/eflora_display.php?tid=33474">drawing of the palea</a> of both species, and CalPhotos has a <a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0614+1342">photo</a> of M. californicus paleae.  The palea wing orientation may be easier to see when one palea is removed from the head as in these pictures.
