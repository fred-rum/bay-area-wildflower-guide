sci:Allium spp.
taxon_id: 47357
x:!hist/rare

A major distinguishing feature is the outer bulb coat cell structure.  So an ID may be impossible without digging up a plant.


Other key features:
. number of leaves per stem (1, 2, or more)
. leaf sickle-shaped or not
. leaf flat, channeled (curved), or cylindric (curled)
. stem winged (above) or not
. number of ovary crests [not visible in photos]
. pedicel length
. flower length, shape
. inner perianth parts dentate, serrate, or not

All onions can be pink/purple to white, so color is not a strong ID feature.
