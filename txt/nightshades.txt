The anthers are generally fused to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Key features:
. Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
. Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.

==bluewitch nightshade:S. umbelliferum
color: purple
. upper stem hairs generally dense, branched
. leaf 1--4 cm, ovate, obovate, or elliptic, generally entire

==purple nightshade:S. xanti
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0110+1545
. stem +- hairy, hairs are unbranched, glandular or not [<a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0119+2997">example</a>]
. leaf 2--7 cm, lanceolate to ovate, +- entire to 1--2-lobed at base; base obtuse to +- cordate

==new zealand nightshade:S. aviculare
. leaf 10--30 cm, +- entire to deeply 1--2-lobed below middle

==silverleaf nightshade:S. elaeagnifolium
. plant often prickly

<h3>White nightshades</h3>

Fruit key features:
. glossy or dull
. sepals reflexed or not

Flower key features:
. corolla diameter
. anther length
. style strongly exserted or not

Stanford's Jasper Ridge program has a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/JRBP/plants/PDF/Solanum%20key.pdf">key (PDF)</a> for white-flowered nightshades.  Much more information about useful and non-useful features are in a free <a href="https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/31738/">research article</a> by Knapp et al.

The inflorescence typically has its flowers branching from a very short rhachis (axis), although occasionally they can be spaced out more.  Jepson and Stanford pretend to distinguish raceme-like and umbel-like inflorescences, but there appears to be no consistent difference.  The inflorescence is usually distinctly forked in {-forked nightshade), but other species may also rarely be forked.

Jepson and Stanford both list deceptive corolla widths which I have corrected according to my observations and Knapp.  I've copied the anther lengths from Jepson, but have not yet attempted to verify their ranges.

The anthers are closely packed to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

==forked nightshade:S. furcatum
color:white
. <b>inflorescence forked</b> into two distinct, +- balanced sections
. corolla: 12--20 mm diameter including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
.. anthers 2.3--3.3 mm
.. <b>filaments distinct</b>

==greenspot nightshade:S. douglasii
color: white
. infloresecnce rarely forked
.. <b>peduncle 1.5--4 cm long</b>; <b>pedicels 10--41 mm long</b>, 0.3--0.4 mm in diameter at the base and 0.4--0.6 mm in diameter at the apex
. corolla: <b>13--15+ mm diameter</b> including lobes, white, possibly tinged with lavender, w/ yellow/green spots at base often with a brown tinge or margin
.. <b>anthers 2.5--4.5 mm</b>
.. <b>filaments indistinct</b>
.. <b>style strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
. leaf: 1--9 cm, entire to coarsely irregularly <b>toothed</b>
. hairs: generally simple, < 1mm, +- curved, white
. fruit: <b>glossy</b> w/ <b>sepals not reflexed</b>
. stems angled, rough-hairy, woody

==black nightshade:S. nigrum
color: white
. infloresecnce rarely forked
.. <b>peduncle 0.5--1.5 cm long</b>, straight; <b>pedicels 3--5 mm long</b>, 0.2--0.3 mm in diameter at the base and 0.2--0.3 mm at the apex
. corolla: <b>10--17 mm diameter</b> including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.4 mm</b>
.. if we believe CalPhotos, style may or may not be strongly exerted beyond anthers
. leaf: 4--7 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- spreading or curved, <b>glandular</b> and not
. calyx lobes partially fused, not reflexed in fruit
. fruit: <b>dull</b>
.. [photographs show the sepals in fruit being strongly, weakly, or not reflexed, but Jasper Ridge says they're never reflexed]

==american black nightshade:S. americanum
color: white
. corolla: <b>5--8 mm diameter including lobes</b> [example,2], white
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.2 mm</b>
.. <b>style not strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
.. note that the style-to-anther ratio listed in Jepson is similar in all white nightshades, but this one has longer filaments
. infloresence typically umbel-like, but rarely highly branched
. leaf: 2--15 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- 0 or short, +- appressed or curved, nonglandular
. fruit: <b>glossy</b> w/ <b>sepals reflexed</b>

==hairy nightshade:S. physalifolium var. nitidibaccatum
. corolla: <b>3--5 mm wide</b>, white
. leaf: 2--6 cm, ovate, entire to irregular-toothed or shallowly lobed
. hairs: spreading, some glandular
. fruit: +- yellow or green
. rare
