x:hist/rare

The anthers are generally fused to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

The european "deadly nightshade" can be fatal after eating as few as 10 berries, but it is a different genus with a different toxin. Ripe {-Solanum} berries are non-toxic, but the leaves and unripe (green) berries are quite toxic, although probably not fatal. ^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_nigrum However, I wouldn't eat any of it if I were you.

<h3>Purple-flowered nightshades</h3>

Key features:
. Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
. Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.

==bluewitch nightshade:S. umbelliferum
color: purple
. upper stem hairs generally dense, branched
. leaf 1--4 cm, ovate, obovate, or elliptic, generally entire

==purple nightshade:S. xanti
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0110+1545
. stem +- hairy, hairs are unbranched, glandular or not [<a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0119+2997">example</a>]
. leaf 2--7 cm, lanceolate to ovate, +- entire to 1--2-lobed at base; base obtuse to +- cordate
. as of 2023, the only undisputed iNaturalist observations in the bay area are in Marin, and none of those are research grade

==new zealand nightshade:S. aviculare
. leaf 10--30 cm, +- entire to deeply 1--2-lobed below middle
. no iNaturalist observations in the bay area
. rare in Calflora, mostly in urban areas

==silverleaf nightshade:S. elaeagnifolium
. plant often prickly
. [leaves look different than {-bluewitch nightshade}
. yellow fruit
. very rare in the bay area, mostly associated with mulch in urban areas

<h3>White-flowered nightshades</h3>

Fruit key features:
. glossy or dull
. sepals reflexed or not

Flower key features:
. corolla diameter
. anther length
. style strongly exserted or not

Stanford's Jasper Ridge program has a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/JRBP/plants/PDF/Solanum%20key.pdf">key (PDF)</a> for some white-flowered nightshades.  Much more information about useful and non-useful features are in a free <a href="https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/31738/">research article</a> by Knapp et al.

The inflorescence typically has its flowers branching from a very short rhachis (axis), although occasionally they can be spaced out more.  Jepson and Stanford pretend to distinguish raceme-like and umbel-like inflorescences, but there appears to be no consistent difference.  The inflorescence is usually distinctly forked in {-forked nightshade), but other species may also rarely be forked.

Jepson and Stanford both list deceptive corolla widths which I have corrected according to my observations and Knapp.  I've copied the anther lengths from Jepson, but have not yet attempted to verify their ranges.

The anthers are closely packed to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

==forked nightshade:S. furcatum
color:white
. <b>inflorescence forked</b> into two distinct, +- balanced sections
. corolla: 12--20 mm diameter including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
.. anthers 2.3--3.3 mm
... anthers ellipsoid
.. <b>filaments distinct</b>; free portion (where the filaments are not fused into a single tube)(0.9--1.6 mm) comparable in length to the anther (2.3--3.3 mm)
.. <b>style strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
.. bud +- spherical
... style strongly exerted from the bud

==greenspot nightshade:S. douglasii
color: white
acom:douglas nightshade
. infloresecnce rarely forked
.. <b>peduncle 1.5--4 cm long</b>; <b>pedicels 10--41 mm long</b>, 0.3--0.4 mm in diameter at the base and 0.4--0.6 mm in diameter at the apex
. corolla: <b>13--15+ mm diameter</b> including lobes, white, possibly tinged with lavender, w/ yellow/green spots at base often with a brown tinge or margin
.. <b>anthers 2.5--4.5 mm</b>
... anthers ellipsoid and slightly tapered towards the tips
.. <b>filaments indistinct</b>; free portion (where the filaments are not fused into a single tube) (0.1--0.5 mm) about 1/4 the length of the anther (3--4.5 mm, usually > 4 mm in North America)
.. <b>style strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
.. bud +- ellipsoid, tapering to the apex
... style not exerted from the bud
. leaf: 1--9 cm, entire to coarsely irregularly <b>toothed</b>
. hairs: generally simple, < 1mm, +- curved, white
. fruit: <b>glossy</b> w/ <b>sepals not reflexed</b>
. stems angled, rough-hairy, woody

==black nightshade:S. nigrum
color: white
taxon_id:79141
. infloresecnce rarely forked
.. <b>peduncle 0.5--1.5 cm long</b>, straight; <b>pedicels 3--5 mm long</b>, 0.2--0.3 mm in diameter at the base and 0.2--0.3 mm at the apex
. corolla: <b>10--17 mm diameter</b> including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.4 mm</b>
.. if we believe CalPhotos, style may or may not be strongly exerted beyond anthers
. leaf: 4--7 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- spreading or curved, <b>glandular</b> and not
. calyx lobes partially fused, not reflexed in fruit
. fruit: <b>dull</b>
.. [photographs show the sepals in fruit being strongly, weakly, or not reflexed, but Jasper Ridge says they're never reflexed]

==american black nightshade:S. americanum
color: white
. corolla: <b>5--8 mm diameter including lobes</b> [example,2], white
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.2 mm</b>

.. note that the style-to-anther ratio listed in Jepson is similar in all white nightshades, but this one has longer filaments
. infloresence typically umbel-like, but rarely highly branched
. leaf: 2--15 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- 0 or short, +- appressed or curved, nonglandular
