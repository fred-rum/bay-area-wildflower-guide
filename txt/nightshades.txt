The anthers are generally fused to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Key features:
. Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
. Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.

==bluewitch nightshade:S. umbelliferum
color: purple
. upper stem hairs generally dense, branched
. leaf 1--4 cm, ovate, obovate, or elliptic, generally entire

==purple nightshade:S. xanti
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0110+1545
. stem +- hairy, hairs are unbranched, glandular or not [<a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0119+2997">example</a>]
. leaf 2--7 cm, lanceolate to ovate, +- entire to 1--2-lobed at base; base obtuse to +- cordate

==new zealand nightshade:S. aviculare
. leaf 10--30 cm, +- entire to deeply 1--2-lobed below middle

==silverleaf nightshade:S. elaeagnifolium
. plant often prickly

<h3>White nightshades</h3>

Fruit key features:
. glossy or dull
. sepals reflexed or not

Flower key features:
. corolla diameter
. anther length
. style strongly exserted or not

The anthers are generally fused to form a golden longitudinally-segmented tube from which the style may or may not be exserted.

Stanford's Jasper Ridge program has a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/JRBP/plants/PDF/Solanum%20key.pdf">key (PDF)</a> for white-flowered nightshades.

Jepson lists some inflorescences as being raceme-like and others as
umbel-like, but they all look the same to me.

Jepson and Stanford both list deceptive corolla widths which I have corrected according to my observations.  I've copied the anther lengths from Jepson, but have not yet attempted to verify their ranges.

Some features are variable within a species, but if a <b>bold feature</b> is seen, it is diagnostic.

==forked nightshade:S. furcatum
color:white
. <b>inflorescence forked</b> into two distinct, +- balanced sections
. corolla: 10--18 mm diameter including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
. anthers 3--3.5 mm

==greenspot nightshade:S. douglasii
color: white
. corolla: <b>10--14 mm diameter</b> including lobes, white, possibly tinged with lavender, w/ yellow/green spots at base often tinged or surrounded by brown
.. <b>anthers 2.5--4.0 mm</b>
.. <b>style strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
. leaf: 1--9 cm, entire to coarsely irregularly <b>toothed</b>
. hairs: generally simple, < 1mm, +- curved, white
. fruit: <b>glossy</b> w/ <b>sepals not reflexed</b>
. stems angled, rough-hairy, woody

==black nightshade:S. nigrum
color: white
. corolla: <b>10--17 mm diameter</b> including lobes, white w/ yellow/green spots at base
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.4 mm</b>
.. if we believe CalPhotos, style may or may not be strongly exerted beyond anthers
. leaf: 4--7 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- spreading or curved, <b>glandular</b> and not
. calyx lobes partially fused, not reflexed in fruit
. fruit: <b>dull</b>
.. [photographs show the sepals in fruit being strongly, weakly, or not reflexed, but Jasper Ridge says they're never reflexed]

==american black nightshade:S. americanum
color: white
. corolla: <b>5--8 mm diameter including lobes</b> [example,2], white
.. <b>anthers 1.4--2.2 mm</b>
.. <b>style not strongly exerted</b> beyond anthers
.. note that the style-to-anther ratio is similar in all white nightshades, but this one has longer filaments
. leaf: 2--15 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +- 0 or short, +- appressed or curved, nonglandular
. fruit: <b>glossy</b> w/ <b>sepals reflexed</b>

==hairy nightshade:S. physalifolium var. nitidibaccatum
. corolla: <b>3--5 mm wide</b>, white
. leaf: 2--6 cm, ovate, entire to irregular-toothed or shallowly lobed
. hairs: spreading, some glandular
. fruit: +- yellow or green
. rare
