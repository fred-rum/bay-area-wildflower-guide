sci:Equisetum
x:hist

Leaves are extremely small, in a whorl from stem nodes, and fused into an appressed sheath.  The number of sheath teeth equals the number of leaves.

Branches are much longer, also in a whorl from stem nodes.  Photosynthesis generally takes place in the stem and branches.

Some species make separate sterile and fertile stems.  Sterile stems are green, but fertile stems may not be.

Key features:
. basal internode of branch < or > subtending nodal sheath
. number of teeth per sheath
. branch hollow or solid

<h2>Separate sterile and fertile stems</h2>
==great horsetail:E. telmateia
. sterile stem 30--100 cm tall, light green, regularly branched
.. basal internode of branch < subtending nodal sheath [significantly?]
.. <b>branch is solid, has 4--5 grooved ridges lengthwise</b>
... [do these look like 4--5 pairs of ridges?]
.. sheath teeth 14--28
. fertile stem 17--45 cm tall, brown, unbranched, fleshy
.. sheath teeth 20--30
. very common

==field horsetail:E. arvense
. sterile stem 10--60 cm tall, green, regularly branched
.. basal internode of branch > subtending sheath [but maybe not by a lot]
.. <b>branch is solid, has 3--4 rounded ridges lengthwise</b>
.. sheath teeth 6--14
. fertile stem 11--32 cm tall, brown, unbranched, fleshy
.. sheath teeth 6--10
. common
