<h2>generally no axillary leaf clusters</h2>

These look fairly distinct from california sagebrush and from each other.  I'll add more notes here as I discover them.

. leaves 1--8 cm wide, entire to pinnately lobed
.. leaves +- glaborus to sparsely tomentose adaxially, glabrous or hairy abaxially
. very common

==silver wormwood:A. ludoviciana
. leaves 0.5--1 cm wide, densely gray-hairy (or becoming +- glabrous adaxially)
. <b>not known to be in the bay area</b>
.. per CalFlora, not in the bay area
.. no research-grade observations in the bay area, but iNaturalist likes to suggest it anyway
