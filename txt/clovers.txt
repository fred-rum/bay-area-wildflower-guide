Much depends on the bracts (involucre), so always photograph the clover head from beneath, and measure the length of the bracts.  The involucre is always snuggled up against the inflorescence, and depending on its size it may or may not hide the pedicels at the base of the inflorescence.

There are generally 5 sepals, generally fused into a calyx for each flower.  There are also generally 5 petals, which may be free, fused, or only the lower 2 +- fused into a keel.  It may be useful to pluck a calyx/corolla combination to get a closer look at the calyx.

Camera angles:
. close look at top/side of inflorescence with scale
. close look at bottom of inflorescence with scale
. leaflets with scale (not the reduced leaflets directly below the inflorescence)
. peduncle with scale

Key features:
. bracts shape (especially if fused) under inflorescence
. calyx lobes plumose or not
. corolla color
. lengths of bracts, sepals (calyx), petals (corolla), leaflets, leaf stipules, peduncle, and consider pulling off a corolla for the pedicel length
. leaflets palmate or pinnate
. leaflet shape
. various parts hairy or glabrous
