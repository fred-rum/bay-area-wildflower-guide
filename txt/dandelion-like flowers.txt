For the purposes of this page, "dandelion-like" is defined as a plant in the {-sunflower family} in which the head is liguliflorous.  This means that it is composed of only a single kind of ray-like corolla in a 3-D arrangement.  This page collects in one place the dandelion-like plants with yellow inflorescences for easier comparison.

Compare with {-yellow daisies}.
