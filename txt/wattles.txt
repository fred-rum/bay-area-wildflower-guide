do disable_obs_promotion_checks_from_needs_id: species # I don't trust some IDs

We have just about all (~14) California species in the bay area.  The Jepson key is fairly straightforward, so I won't bother to replicate the key here.

Key features:
. simple leaves:
.. longer or shorter than 40 mm
.. stipular spines present or not
.. tip spine-like or not
.. with one prominent midvein or 2+
.. leaf shape
.. flowers in spikes or heads
.. leaves, stems resinous or not
.. shrub (spreading from base) or tree (generally with 1 trunk)
. or 2-pinnate leaves:
.. 2--5 pairs of 1st-order leaflets or 6+
.. twigs wingled or angled
.. 2nd-order leaflets < 7 mm or >= 10 mm
.. leaf main axis with raised glands at each pair of 1st-order leaflets or also in between
... glands are only on the adaxial (upper) surface of the axis
... "in between" might just be a raised ridge between glands
